            Jordan Peterson sits down with author and co-founder of Truvani, Vani Hari. They discuss Hari’s personal struggles with food which led her to start the Food Babe blog, the disgraceful business practices of major food companies, how the Tobacco industry took over big food, the unimaginable progress made just recently via the MAHA movement, and where this new surge of hope leads us - should we choose to follow.

Vani Hari is a food activist, a NY Times best-selling author of 4 books, co-founder of the organic food brand Truvani, and was named one of the “Most Influential People on the Internet” by Time magazine. Hari started FoodBabe.com to spread information about what is really in the American food supply. She teaches people how to make the right purchasing decisions at the grocery store, how to live an organic lifestyle, and how to travel healthfully around the world. Vani has influenced how major food giants like Kraft, Subway, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, and Starbucks create their products, steering them towards more healthful policies.

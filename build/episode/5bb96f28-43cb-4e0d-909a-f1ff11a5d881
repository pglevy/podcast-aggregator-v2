            <p>Starbucks. You’d be hard pressed to name any brand that’s more ubiquitous in the world today. With nearly half a billion global customer purchases per week across its stores and 3rd party retail channels, a significant portion of the human population gets their daily fix in the green and white paper cup. (Including our own Ben Gilbert who famously enjoys his daily spinach feta wrap. :)</p><p>But it wasn’t always this way. Long before the frappuccinos and the PSLs and the cake pops, Starbucks was just a small-time Seattle roaster that only sold beans — and was started not by Howard Schultz but rather the guys who later ran Peet’s (!). Starting from six tiny stores when Howard took over in 1987, this quirky coffee company named after a character from Moby Dick has scaled to nearly 40,000 locations worldwide.</p><p>Today, in a first for Acquired, the protagonist himself joins us as a third cohost to tell the whole story of Starbucks. And Howard is in the perfect moment to do this — after three separate stints as CEO he’s now retired, off the board of directors, and in his own words “not coming back.” So place a mobile order (or not! as you’ll hear Howard speak about), sit back with your own favorite Starbucks items, and enjoy.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:<br /></strong><br />WorkOS: <a href="https://bit.ly/workos25">https://bit.ly/workos25</a><br />Huntress: <a href="https://bit.ly/acqhuntress">https://bit.ly/acqhuntress</a><br />Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a></p><p><strong>The Biggest Thing We’ve Ever Done:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://acquired.fm/sf">San Francisco.

            Jordan Peterson sits down with physician and lawyer, Dr. Simone Gold. They discuss her personal story of becoming both a doctor and a lawyer, running an ER clinic through the Ebola scare, why she spoke out during the COVID pandemic, how the machine attempted to destroy her public image, January 6th, being raided and imprisoned by the U.S. Government, and why she will not back down. 

Dr. Simone Gold, MD, JD, is America’s expert voice of common sense and scientific clarity in the information war against Medical Marxism. Dr.Gold is an emergency physician, Stanford University - educated attorney, and the visionary who led the pivotal press conference event that broke the spell of the corona virus panic in 2020.

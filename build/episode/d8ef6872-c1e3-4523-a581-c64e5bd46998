            Dr. Peterson’s third biblical series, “The Gospels” is part of his lifelong effort to rescue society from the meaning crisis that seeks to devour our culture. In this series, Peterson gathers nine of the world's most brilliant minds to unravel the mysteries of the Gospel stories and to resurrect the anchoring principles of the text that formed the West.

Today, we are releasing episode 1 of this revolutionary but tradition-grounded series. The episode stands on its own but also serves as an introduction to the rest of the ten, two-hour long seminars available exclusively on DailyWire+.

The Daily Wire and Dr. Peterson both hope that you will consider a subscription to DailyWire+, where you can view the Gospel seminar and their other collaborations in their entirety. This includes "Exodus" and "Foundations of the West," as well as his life-altering series that address marriage, how to become successful, developing a vision, the importance of masculinity, and overcoming depression and anxiety. 

Thank you for your time, attention, and continued support of both Dr. Peterson’s work and his partnership with The Daily Wire.

A special thanks to Bishop Robert Barron, Dr. Stephen Blackwood, Dr. Douglas Hedley, Gregg Hurwitz, Konstantin Kisin, Dr. James Orr, Jonathan Pageau, Dr. Dennis Prager, and Dr. John Vervaeke for joining Dr. Peterson and the audience on this journey.

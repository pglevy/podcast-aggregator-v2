            In this episode, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with athlete, philanthropist, and speaker Tim Tebow to discuss the connection between competitive drive, personal virtue, and Christian compassion. Tebow recounts the life-changing encounter that inspired his foundation — a moment in a remote Filipino village, where he met a disabled boy hidden away from the world. From that day forward, his focus shifted from MVP titles to serving the most vulnerable.

Together, they explore the demonization of masculinity, the crisis facing young men today, and how athletic excellence, when rooted in higher purpose, can become a force for good. This is a conversation about strength, faith, responsibility, and redemption — and what it truly means to win at life.

Timothy Richard Tebow, born August 14, 1987, in Makati, the Philippines to missionary parents Bob and Pam Tebow, is an American professional baseball player, former professional football player, 3x NY Times best-selling author, international speaker, and ESPN sports broadcaster. He played college football for the University of Florida, and in 2007 became the first player to win the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore. Tim is also a 2x BCS National Champion. In the NFL, Tim played for the Denver Broncos, the New York Jets, the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. He is currently playing baseball as an outfielder and designated hitter with the New York Mets MLB team.

This episode was filmed on March 23rd, 2025.

            Jordan Peterson sits down with experimental cosmologist Dr. Brian Keating. They discuss the importance of awe for the human spirit, the fundamental ethos behind all true science, the idea of the useless genius, and the necessity of sacrifice for improvement of the self and the broader community.

Brian Keating is a Professor of Physics and an experimental cosmologist. He works on observations of the cosmic microwave background, the leftover heat from the Big Bang, and is the Principal Investigator of the Simons Observatory, located at a 17,000-foot elevation in the Chilean Atacama desert. He received his PhD from Brown in 2000 and is a distinguished professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of two books and has produced the first-ever audiobook by his intellectual hero, Galileo Galilei, “The Dialogue on Two World Systems.” He hosts the “INTO THE IMPOSSIBLE” podcast and teaches cosmology and astronomy at Peterson Academy. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 2024, he was invested as a member of the American Academy of Sciences and Letters.

This episode was filmed on December 5th, 2024.

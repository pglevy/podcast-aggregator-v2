            Jordan Peterson sits down with bestselling author and bioenergetics Ph.D., Dr. Benjamin Bikman. They discuss the epidemic of insulin resistance in America and its profound effects on health, the sugar addiction crisis, how dopamine hijacks your brain, how to navigate the American diet, and the potential to fix it invitationally from the top down over the next four years. 

Benjamin Bikman earned a Ph.D. in bioenergetics at East Carolina University with a focus on the adaptations to metabolic surgeries in obesity. He continued to explore metabolic disorders, with a particular focus on insulin resistance, as a postdoctoral fellow at the Duke-National University of Singapore. As a professor at Brigham Young University and the director of its Diabetes Research Lab, Dr. Bikman has continued to study insulin, including its role as a regulator of human metabolism, as well as insulin’s relevance in chronic disease. In addition to his research and teaching, Dr. Bikman actively serves as a research mentor to undergraduate and graduate students. He and his students frequently present and publish their findings.

This episode was filmed on January 27th, 2025.

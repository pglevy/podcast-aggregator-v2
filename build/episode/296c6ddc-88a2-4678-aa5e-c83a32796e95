            Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with CEO of the Justice Defense Fund, Laila Mickelwait. They discuss her ongoing efforts against the largest adult content platform in the world, their shady dealings with credit card companies, top-down refusal of proper moderation, potential safeguards which would benefit performers, and how anonymity fuels psychopathy on the internet.

Laila Mickelwait is the founder and CEO of the Justice Defense Fund and the founder of the global #Traffickinghub movement supported by millions around the world. She has been combating the crime of sex trafficking since 2006 and is a leading expert in the field. The Traffickinghub movement that Laila continues to lead is a decentralized global effort to hold Pornhub accountable for enabling and profiting from child abuse, sex trafficking, rape, and the criminal exploitation of countless victims. Traffickinghub has earned hundreds of millions of views on social media, and the petition to shut down Pornhub has been signed by over 2.3 million people from every country in the world. 600 organizations have participated in the effort and the impact of the movement has been covered globally in thousands of media pieces.

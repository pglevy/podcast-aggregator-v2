            Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with the new leader of the UK Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch. They discuss her multinational upbringing, how that informed her on the fallacies of multiculturalism, the necessary preconditions of a functioning society, the current political landscape of the UK, and why anger resonates - but cannot rebuild.

The Rt Hon Kemi Badenoch was Secretary of State for the Department for Business and Trade between 7 February 2023 and 5 July 2024. She was Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade between 6 September 2022 and 4 July 2024, and Minister for Women and Equalities for the Equality Hub between 25 October 2022 and 4 July 2024. Previously she was Minister of State at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities between 16 September 2021 and 6 July 2022. She was Minister of State (Minister for Equalities) in the Equality Hub between 14 February 2020 and July 2022. She was previously Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury from 13 February 2020 to 15 September 2021 and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Education from 27 July 2019 to 13 February 2020.

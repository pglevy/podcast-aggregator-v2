                <p class="card-text text-truncate">I&#39;ve read this interview probably 10 times. It&#39;s that good. Steve Jobs was 29 when the interview was published and with remarkable clarity of thought Steve explains the upcoming technological revolution, why the personal computer is the greatest tool humans have ever invented, how the computer compares to past inventions, why software needs to be simplified (You shouldn&#39;t have to read a novel to write a novel!) why the future is always exciting and unpredictable, what soul in the game looks like and why his competitors don&#39;t have any, why slightly insane people are the ones who make great products, the importance of questioning things and how doing so produces novel insights, why it&#39;s dangerous to have layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work, the importance of hiring troublemakers, why more people should aspire to be like Edwin Land, and how if he every leaves Apple he will always come back.

The petrochemical revolution gave us free energy—free mechanical energy, in this case. It changed the texture of society in most ways. This revolution, the information revolution, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy. This revolution will dwarf the petrochemical revolution. We’re on the forefront. A computer is the most incredible tool we’ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a supercalculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer. We have no idea how far it’s going to go The hard part of what we’re up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can’t tell them. A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked Alexander Graham Bell, “What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?” he wouldn’t have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world. He didn’t know that people would use the telephone to call up and find out what movies were playing that night or to order some groceries or call a relative on the other side of the globe. That is what Macintosh is all about. It’s the first “telephone” of our industry. Ad campaigns are necessary for competition; IBM’s ads are everywhere. But good PR educates people; that’s all it is. You can’t con people in this business. The products speak for themselves. We didn’t build Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through. The people in the Mac group wanted to build the greatest computer that has ever been seen.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 3 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">That Dwight D. Eisenhower became Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, orchestrating the largest amphibious invasion in history on June 6, 1944, was far from inevitable. He came from the middle of nowhere — Abilene, Kansas — had never led men in battle, spent most of his career as a staff officer, and didn’t make general until he was in his fifties. How, then, did he become the leader on whom the fate of the world would rest? Today, we trace the making of Ike with Michel Paradis, author of The Light of Battle. We talk about how Eisenhower’s Midwestern upbringing shaped his character, and how his most important education happened outside the classroom. Michel shares how crucial mentors were in Ike’s development, and how Eisenhower made the most of those relationships. We discuss the books that were most formative in shaping his thinking, including what he got from Nietzsche. We also get into some of the practices Eisenhower used to lead effectively, including how he budgeted his time to maintain his morale while under the pressure of planning D-Day and what he did the evening before the invasion to deal with the stress.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 2 at 4:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and journalist Megyn Kelly dissect the cultural and psychological forces reshaping modern gender dynamics—particularly the rising unhappiness among young women, the suppression of traditional masculinity, and the consequences of empathy-driven institutions. They explore maternal overreach, the devaluation of motherhood, the politicization of victimhood, and the unintended fallout of feminism’s gains in the corporate and academic world. This episode unpacks how men and women are drifting further apart—politically, emotionally, and biologically—and asks whether modern society is equipped to repair the divide wrought by extreme feminism. This episode was filmed on May 28th, 2025. There’s nothing more difficult—or more important—than raising a child. In this new 5-part series, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson brings decades of clinical insight to the questions every parent faces: discipline, identity, responsibility, and what it truly means to guide a child toward a meaningful life.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 2 at 1:54 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">We sit down with Steve Ballmer, the legendary former Microsoft CEO and owner of the LA Clippers, for an epic conversation covering his 34 years at Microsoft. Steve listened to our Microsoft episodes and had some thoughts to share — and boy, did he deliver. Steve takes us point-by-point through the original IBM DOS deal that started everything, how he built Microsoft&#39;s enterprise business from scratch, and offers his candid reflections on missing mobile and search. We also cover the story behind “developers, developers, developers”, the complexities of his relationship with Bill Gates (including a year where they didn&#39;t speak), and why he ultimately decided to step down as CEO. Plus, we learn why Steve has held onto his Microsoft stock through it all — giving him arguably the best investment track record in the world over the last 10 years with his net worth growing from $20B to $130B since leaving. And of course, we couldn&#39;t resist also talking about his other passion: the Clippers and Intuit Dome. Hit play and get ready to experience the patented Steve Ballmer energy and fun on full display!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Summer ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 29 at 4:33 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Is our planet doomed? Probably not, it turns out. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson joins geologist Scott Tinker to dismantle the myth of energy scarcity, exposing the flawed narratives that demonize coal, oil, and natural gas. Together, they reject the false binary of renewables versus fossil fuels, arguing instead for an abundant future powered by both. This conversation confronts the culture of fear that paralyzes progress and issues a stark warning: if the West continues to undermine its own energy and technological ambitions in service of an ideological green agenda, it risks ceding global leadership to authoritarian regimes like China. Innovation, prosperity, and freedom depend on confronting reality—not retreating from it.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 27 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">The British just seem like a classier bunch. Part of it is that winning accent. But it&#39;s also because English culture has long been steeped in the tradition of learning and practicing etiquette. Here to share some of the essentials of modern etiquette that are important no matter which side of the pond you live on is William Hanson, a British etiquette expert and the author of Just Good Manners. William shares the difference between manners and etiquette, and why young people are especially interested in both. He then takes us through how to introduce yourself and others, the history behind the &#34;no elbows on the table&#34; mantra, the rules of small talk, some overlooked guidelines for table manners, how to enter a conversational circle at a party, considerations for elevator etiquette, and much more. Whether you&#39;re dining at a fancy restaurant or just want to navigate social situations with more confidence, William&#39;s insights will help you present yourself with the panache of a proper English gentleman.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 26 at 1:14 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When Tamara Mellon’s father lent her the seed money to start a high-end shoe company, he cautioned her: “Don’t let the accountants run your business.” Little did he know that over the next fifteen years, the struggle between “financial” and “creative” would become one of the central themes as Mellon’s business. Mellon grew Jimmy Choo into a billion dollar brand and her personal glamour made her an object of global media fascination. Vogue photographed her wedding. Vanity Fair covered her divorce and the criminal trial that followed. The Wall Street Journal reported on her relentless battle between “the suits” and “the creatives&#34; and Mellon’s triumph against a brutally hostile takeover attempt. But despite her eventual fame and fortune, Mellon didn’t have an easy road to success. Her early life was marked by a tumultuous and broken family life, battles with anxiety and depression, and a stint in rehab. Determined not to end up unemployed, penniless, and living in her parents’ basement under the control of her alcoholic mother, Mellon honed her natural business sense and invested in what she knew best—fashion. In creating the shoes that became a fixture on Sex and the City and red carpets around the world, Mellon relied on her own impeccable sense of what the customer wanted—because she was that customer. What she didn’t know at the time was that success would come at a high price—after struggles with an obstinate business partner, a conniving first CEO, a turbulent marriage, and a mother who tried to steal her hard-earned wealth. Now Mellon shares the whole larger-than-life story, with shocking details that have never been presented before. From her troubled childhood to her time as a young editor at Vogue to her partnership with the cobbler Jimmy Choo, to her very public relationships, Mellon offers an honest and gripping account of the episodes that have made her who she is today. In My Shoes is a definitive book for fashion aficionados, aspiring entrepreneurs, and anyone who loves a juicy true story about sex, drugs, money, power, high heels, and overcoming adversity. This episode is what I learned from reading In My Shoes: A Memoir by Tamara Mellon. ----- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh—filmmaker, provocateur, and cultural lightning rod. They unpack the making of two viral documentaries, What Is a Woman? and Am I Racist?, and the philosophical and political firestorms surrounding them. Matt pulls back the curtain on what it takes to expose ideology masquerading as morality—why he uses comedy, performance, and confrontation to challenge cultural frauds. From uncomfortable interviews to media backlash, the conversation explores the psychological toll and moral convictions that drive his work. From the psychology of editing, storytelling, and satire to the dangers of resentment-fueled ideologies like radical feminism they dismantle the facade of modern wokeness—and what comes next. Watch now and discover the real battleground.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Uncertainty is a constant of human existence. How will market conditions affect your new business venture? What will be the results of the medical test you just took? Will a new relationship work out? For most of us, situations of uncertainty trigger anxiety, even fear. But the stress of uncertainty doesn&#39;t have to overwhelm you. You can learn to navigate it with secure, adaptable confidence so you can keep thriving and progress towards your ultimate goals. Today on the show, Rich Diviney, a retired Navy SEAL commander, returns to share insights from his new book Masters of Uncertainty. He first explains why thinking that life will be predictable keeps people from realizing their potential. He then walks us through practical techniques for dealing with uncertainty like &#34;moving horizons,&#34; creating meaningful goals that work with our brain chemistry, and de-stressing your body so you can be more resilient and make better decisions under pressure. We also discuss how understanding your unique attributes will help you understand how you react to uncertainty and how teams can implement &#34;dynamic subordination&#34; to adapt in rapidly changing environments.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 15 at 8:08 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">(I fixed the audio and uploaded a new episode!) &#34;To read Jeff Bezos’s shareholder letters is to get a crash course in running a high-growth internet business from someone who mastered it before any of the playbooks were written.&#34; That is the best description of Bezos&#39;s letters I have ever read. I just finished rereading these letters for the 4th or 5th time. With clear thinking and ferocious intelligence, Bezos provides a masterclass in building a customer-obsessed, enduring franchise. With relentless repetition Bezos teaches us about the importance of invention, risk-taking, wandering, differentiation, technology, judgement, high-standards, customer obsession, long-term orientation, and why value trumps everything. Read the letters on Amazon&#39;s website here. Or in the book Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos Register for the live event in New York at Ramp!

Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book ( 15:00 ) Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon success. It&#39;s not easy to work here but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren&#39;t meant to be easy. ( 24:00 ) We believe we have reached a &#34;tipping point,&#34; where this platform allows us to launch new ecommerce businesses faster, with a higher quality of customer experience, a lower incremental cost, a higher chance of success, and a faster path to scale and profitability than any other company. ( 27:00 ) We will continue to invest heavily in introductions to new customers. Though it&#39;s sometimes hard to imagine with all that has happened in the last five years, this remains Day 1 for ecommerce, and these are the early days of category formation where many customers are forming relationships for the first time. We must work hard to grow the number of customers who shop with us. ( 37:00 ) Focus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford to lower prices, which drives growth. Growth spreads fixed costs across more sales, reducing cost per unit, which makes possible more price reductions. Customers like this, and it&#39;s good for shareholders. Please expect us to repeat this loop. ( 47:00 ) Our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years or more. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon. ( 55:00 ) Our fundamental approach remains the same. Stay heads down, focused on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long-term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn&#39;t otherwise contemplate. Seek instant gratification and chances are you&#39;ll find a crowd there ahead of you. ( 56:00 ) Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution. ( 59:00 ) Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers. ( 1:00:00 ) A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it&#39;s durable in time-with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these get married. ( 1:02:00 ) We all know that if you swing for the fences, you&#39;re going to strike out a lot, but you&#39;re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score one thousand runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it&#39;s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments. ( 1:10:00) When a memo isn&#39;t great, it&#39;s not the writer&#39;s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They&#39;re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we&#39;re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can&#39;t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope-that a great memo probably should take a week or more. ( 1:12:00 ) Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you&#39;re going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute. In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient-but it&#39;s also not random. It&#39;s guided-by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it&#39;s worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there. Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries-the &#34;nonlinear&#34; ones-are highly likely to require wandering. ---- Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history&#39;s greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B.

Jocko shares how to recognize the problems that matter, transform them into opportunities, and cultivate the habits that compound into lasting success.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 13 at 7:06 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode, I share my conversation with Roberts Rurans, a Latvia-based illustrator who creates all his work using traditional materials — literally painting his images with acrylics. When Roberts talks about his brushes, he means the actual ones lying on his table, not virtual tools in a menu! His process is physical, full of quirks, accidents, and unexpected moments — and yet, his work feels fresh and totally at home in today’s digital illustration landscape.Roberts has worked with clients like Hermès, Nike, Apple, and Coca-Cola, but his artistic integrity shines through no matter the project. In our conversation, we talk about evolving your style, the tension between old and new work, the difference between art and design, and what it’s really like to work 100% analog in a mostly digital world.Toward the end, Roberts answers questions submitted by my Patreon supporters — including whether he secretly uses any digital tools (you’ll have to listen to find out). I wrap things up with some community notes and another “Embarrassing Story of the Episode,” featuring me, a trail run, some hikers caught unawares, and a well-placed band-aid.IN THIS EPISODEHow Roberts Rurans keeps his fully analog style feeling freshThoughts on evolving your style without disowning the pastThe line between art and design in illustrationAnalog tools vs. digital tools — which gives you the edge?PLUS - Embarrassing Moment of the Episode: Shirtless in the ForestSHOW LINKSRoberts Rurans on Instagram – https://www.instagram.com/robertsruransRoberts’s website – https://www.robertsrurans.comHOW TO SUPPORTShare this episode with your friends!Like/Subscribe/Follow/Comment/ReviewBecome a $3 Supporter or $8 Drawing Buddy on Patreon.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Community is one of life&#39;s most valuable but increasingly scarce resources. While we hear about a supposed epidemic of male loneliness, many men still resist joining groups or struggle to maintain involvement after initial enthusiasm wanes. Today on the show, Frank Schwartz will help us understand the barriers to building male community and how to overcome them. Frank is the CEO of F3, a free, all-volunteer men&#39;s leadership organization that uses workouts to bring men together and supports hundreds of decentralized chapters worldwide. In the first half of our conversation, Frank explains the psychology behind men&#39;s hesitation to join groups, how to navigate the &#34;wish dream&#34; of idealized community, and why expecting perfection kills participation. We then discuss what makes leadership in a decentralized group different from traditional hierarchies, the importance of embracing messiness, and why allowing men to make their own decisions creates stronger leaders than giving them a rulebook to follow. We end our conversation with Frank&#39;s perspective on cultivating patience as a leader and how to measure success when building a community of men.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 8 at 8:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan Peterson breaks down what the media has framed as a battle between Harvard University and the Trump administration—but it&#39;s much deeper than that. Peterson exposes the ideological decay at the heart of elite academic institutions, driven by the dogma of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and enforced through cowardice, corruption, and groupthink. From firsthand experience at Harvard, McGill, and the University of Toronto, Peterson connects the dots between academia&#39;s collapse and its ripple effect on society. With insights into why DEI statements are eroding scientific credibility, how universities became ideological factories, and why the future of higher education may lie in alternatives like Peterson Academy, this episode is a must-watch for anyone who cares about truth, merit, and intellectual freedom.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Figuring out the pitfalls and best practices of adulthood can be tricky. It&#39;s helpful to have some pearls of wisdom to guide you along the way. My guest today has spent decades collecting these kinds of helpful truths and has crafted her own guiding mantras of maturity. Gretchen Rubin is the author of numerous bestselling books, including The Happiness Project, and her latest, Secrets of Adulthood. Today on the show, Gretchen shares how she came to write hundreds of aphorisms on how to navigate life, and we dig into some of my favorites of these concise, sage sayings. Amongst many topics, we discuss why &#34;happiness doesn&#39;t always make us feel happy,&#34; the best strategy for changing ourselves, a very useful heuristic for making decisions, why you should wear a favorite sweater more often, and even why big top tables at restaurants are one of my pet peeves.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 1 at 8:30 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Jim Simons never took a single class on finance, wasn’t interested in business, and didn’t start trading full time until he was 40. The company he founded — Renaissance Technologies — has made over $100 billion in profits. Starting out with the heretical belief that there was a hidden structure in financial markets, Jim decided to staff his “crazy hedge fund” with mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists. He went to great lengths to collect more historic financial data than anyone else, spent a lot of time recruiting “killers” (people with single minded focus that wouldn’t quit), invested heavily in computers (and the people who ran them), and designed the most collaborative work environment. Jim was a world-class mathematician, code breaker, exceptional manager of people with exceptional minds, a genius in system design, and deeply understood the power of incentives. He was also incapable of giving up, willing to endure a decade of struggle and pain, and hell-bent on doing something “historic” with his life. Jim Simons lived a life defined by persistence, unconventional thinking, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. Studying his life and work is time well spent. This episode is what I learned from rereading The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 29 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Feelings of burnout and boredom have become prevalent in modern life. To understand the roots of and solutions to these issues, we can turn to both ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers. Among the latter is Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han, whose thought-provoking analyses are gaining increasing recognition. If you’re not yet familiar with Han’s philosophy, Steven Knepper, a professor at the Virginia Military Institute and the co-author of a new critical introduction to this modern philosopher’s work, will take us on a tour of some of Han’s key ideas. In the first part of our conversation, Steven unpacks Han’s concept of the “burnout society” and why so many of us feel tired from participating in what he calls “auto-exploitation” and “positive violence.” We then discuss how our burnout society is also a “palliative society” that tries to avoid suffering at all costs and how our obsession with health has turned us into a modern version of Nietzsche’s “last man.” We end our discussion with some of Han’s ideas for resisting the pitfalls of modernity, including embracing ritual, contemplation, and an openness to the mystery of others.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 22 at 7:58 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Akio Morita was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Sony. Born as the first son and fifteenth-generation heir to a 300-year-old sake-brewing family in Japan, Akio eschewed the traditional path to forge his own legacy in electronics. In post-war Japan, Akio joined forces with Masaru Ibuka to found Sony. They started in a burned-out department store with limited resources—to build their first product they had to buy supplies on the black market. Akio was determined to change the global perception of Japanese goods as poor quality. From day one he set out to build high-quality, differentiated products, targeted at affluent markets. Akio believed in long-term vision over short-term profits, product innovation without market research, and brand building over immediate profits. Against all opposition, including inside of his own company, Akio invented one of the most successful consumer products of all time: The Walkman. It sold over 400 million units and inspired countless other entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, James Dyson, and Phil Knight. This episode is what I learned from rereading Akio&#39;s classic 1986 autobiography Made In Japan. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 22 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Note: This is a rebroadcast. Do you have a goal to lose weight? If so, you&#39;re probably thinking about how you need to exercise more. And that can certainly help. But what about the 23 hours a day you&#39;re not at the gym? How much you move during those hours — from walking to the mailbox to fidgeting at your desk — can be just as important in winning the battle of the bulge. Here to explain the importance of what&#39;s called non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT, is Dr. James Levine, a professor, the co-director of the Mayo Clinic&#39;s Obesity Solutions Initiative, the inventor of the treadmill desk, and the author of Get Up!: Why Your Chair Is Killing You and What You Can Do About It. James explains how much more sedentary we are than we used to be and what happens to your body when, as the average American does, you spend two-thirds of your day sitting. He shares how doing the lightest kinds of physical activity, even standing more, can help you lose a significant amount of weight and improve other aspects of health, from your sleep to your mood. And we talk about how to easily incorporate more NEAT into your day.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">What if we told you that the most important company in US healthcare was run from a farm in rural Wisconsin? And that farm contained the world’s largest subterranean auditorium, as well as Disneyland—style replicas of Hogwarts and the Emerald City? What if we told you that the person who started, runs and owns this establishment has legally ensured that it will never be sold, never go public and never acquire another company? And that this person, Judy Faulkner, is also likely the wealthiest and most successful self-made woman in history?Welcome to the story of Epic Systems, the software company that underpins the majority of the American healthcare system today. Epic isn’t “just” an electronic medical record (the category it’s usually lumped into), or an online patient portal (which is how most of the US population interacts with it via its MyChart application). It’s more akin to a central nervous system for hospitals and health clinics. Almost everything in a hospital — from patient interactions to billing, staffing, scheduling, prescriptions and even research — happens on Epic’s platform, and over 90% of American medical schools’ graduating doctors, nurses and health administrative staff are trained on it during their educations. Tune in as we dive into the almost-unbelievable story of how this epic company came to be!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 15 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">The era of artificially intelligent large language models is upon us and isn&#39;t going away. Rather, AI tools like ChatGPT are only going to get better and better and affect more and more areas of human life. If you haven&#39;t yet felt both amazed and unsettled by these technologies, you probably haven&#39;t explored their true capabilities. My guest today will explain why everyone should spend at least 10 hours experimenting with these chatbots, what it means to live in an age where AI can pass the bar exam, beat humans at complex tests, and even make us question our own creative abilities, what AI might mean for the future of work and education, and how to use these new tools to enhance rather than detract from your humanity. Ethan Mollick is a professor at the Wharton business school and the author of Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI. Today on the show, Ethan explains the impact of the rise of AI and why we should learn to utilize tools like ChatGPT as a collaborator — a co-worker, co-teacher, co-researcher, and coach. He offers practical insights into harnessing AI to complement your own thinking, remove tedious tasks from your workday, and amplify your productivity. We&#39;ll also explore how to craft effective prompts for large language models, maximize their potential, and thoughtfully navigate what may be the most profound technological shift of our lifetimes.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">This is one of the most extraordinary founder stories you will ever hear. Michael Dell started his company with $1000 when he was 19 years old. The revenues for the first 16 years of Dell look like this: 1984 $6M 1985 $33M 1986 $67M 1987 $159M 1988 $258M 1989 $388M 1990 $546M 1991 $890M 1992 $2B 1993 $2.9B 1994 $3.5B 1995 $5.3B 1996 $7.8B 1997 $12.3B 1998 $18.2B 1999 $25.3B Dell had been profitable for every quarter of its existence. By 2012 the story had changed. The consensus was that Dell was dead. Michael Dell certainly didn&#39;t think so — and besides—he was incapable of giving up on the company that bears his name. As he said at the time &#34;I will care about this company after I&#39;m dead!&#34; Michael takes his company private, completes the largest acquisition in technology history, and remerges perfectly positioned for the age of AI. Michael Dell has been working on his company for over 40 years and it feels like he&#39;s just getting started. In his autobiography he shares the most important lessons he&#39;s learned. It&#39;s a treasure trove for entrepreneurs and leaders. This episode is what I learned from reading Play Nice But Win: A CEO&#39;s Journey From Founder to Leader by Michael Dell and Direct From Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry by Michael Dell. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 8 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When you scroll through social media feeds today, you’ll find countless posts about “living your truth” and “being authentic.” These ideas feel so natural to us now that we rarely stop to ask where they came from or what they really mean. The concept of identity — how we understand ourselves — has undergone a radical transformation over the centuries. What once was defined primarily by external markers like family, profession, and community has shifted dramatically toward inner feelings, desires, and psychological experiences. Today on the show, Carl Trueman unpacks this profound change and how we got to the lens through which we view ourselves today. Carl is a professor, theologian, and the author of The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self. Throughout our conversation, he explores the insights of three key thinkers — Charles Taylor, Philip Rieff, and Alasdair MacIntyre — who have mapped the historical and cultural shifts that have transformed our ideas of identity. We discuss how this transformation has reshaped politics, education, and religion, while considering whether we’ve lost something essential in moving from a shared understanding of human nature to an increasingly individualized conception of self.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Because of the podcast I get to meet a lot of super successful people. I&#39;m always asking them &#34;Who is the smartest person you know&#34; and &#34;Who do you think has the best business?&#34;. &#34;Ken Griffin&#34; is a very common answer. I&#39;ve heard Ken described in two ways: &#34;Winner&#34; and &#34;Killer&#34;. For years I&#39;ve come across interesting anecdotes about Ken. Like when he appears as a 19 year old kid in Ed Thorp&#39;s excellent autobiography A Man For All Markets. Or when John Arnold describe Ken&#39;s intense competitive drive following the blowup of Enron. And then consider the fact that I&#39;m obsessed with people who run their business for decades (Ken founded Citadel 35 years ago and Citadel Securities 23 years ago) — and I knew I had to make an episode about his life and work. The only problem was there&#39;s no great biography of Ken. So to make this episode I transcribed this talk that Ken gave at Yale. And for additional context I read the book Ken recommends: Hardball: Are You Playing to Play or Playing to Win. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Resilience is often touted as the end all, be all of coping with life&#39;s challenges and setbacks. But my guest knows from her studies, executive coaching, and her own life that sometimes resilience just isn&#39;t enough. You need an even more durable source of strength. Dr. Tasha Eurich is an organizational psychologist and researcher and the author of Shatterproof: How to Thrive in a World of Constant Chaos. Today on the show, Tasha explains why the concept of resilience rose to prominence in the 2010s, how resilience can be improved a little as a skill, but is largely an exhaustible capacity, and how you know when you&#39;re hitting your &#34;resilience ceiling.&#34; We then talk about the more sustainable skillset and strength of becoming shatterproof. We discuss the potential to grow forward instead of simply bouncing back, the psychological needs that have to be met to become shatterproof, and research-backed tools for thriving in life instead of just surviving.</p>

That’s a surprising episode.” Well, if you’re in group two, boy do we have a treat for you!IPL is the fastest-growing, most dynamic and most disruptive force in the sports industry today… and this may come as a shock to many Americans, but it might just be on track to surpass the NFL as the world’s most valuable sports league. The IPL is currently valued at $16B, with a TV rights deal that’s higher in per-match dollars than the NBA and the English Premier League. And all this for a league that’s right now just 10 teams who collectively only play 74 total games per season… and oh yeah, the whole thing is only 17 years old!

Bollywood!) and a perfect encapsulation of the rise of modern India.Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 23 at 12:41 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Daniel Ludwig was the richest man in the world and no one knew his name. I&#39;ve read almost 400 biographies of history&#39;s greatest founders and this book is one of my all time favorites. Daniel Ludwig started his company at 19 and was working on it well into his 90s. He built a massive conglomerate of over 200 companies operating in more than 50 countries. Spending the time to learn how he did this is a great investment. This episode will tell you what I learned from rereading The Invisible Billionaire: Daniel Ludwig by Jerry Shields. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

Obsessed with privacy, Ludwig pays a major public relations firm fat fees to keep his name out of the papers. 2. An associate speaks of his unlimited ingenuity in dreaming up new ways of doing things. 3. Ludwig’s most notable characteristic, besides his imagination and pertinacity, is a lifelong penchant for keeping his mouth shut. 4. I&#39;m in this business because I like it. I have no other hobbies. 5. Pertinacity: Holding strongly to an opinion, purpose, or course of action, stubbornly or annoyingly persistent. 6. Risk Game: Self Portrait of an Entrepreneur by Francis Greenburger (Founders #243) 7. At his peak, he owned more than 200 companies in 50 countries. 8. War makes the demand for Ludwig&#39;s products and services skyrocket. 9. Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire by James Wallace and Jim Erickson. (Founders #290) 10. He did not mellow as he grew richer and older. 11. Some years later, the captain of a Ludwig ship made the extravagant mistake of mailing in a report of several pages held together by a paper clip. He received a sharp rebuke for his prodigality: &#34;We do not pay to send ironmongery by air mail!&#34; 12. Ludwig’s tightfistedness, however, persisted after the Depression, putting him in sharp contrast to such free spenders as Onassis and Niarchos. It also was largely responsible for many of his innovations in the shipbuilding industry. 13. Onassis: An Extravagant Life by Frank Brady. (Founders #211) 14. Ludwig’s ridding his ships of any feature that did not contribute to profits pleased his own obsessive sense of economy and kept him a step ahead of the competition. When someone asked why he didn&#39;t put a grand piano aboard his ships, as Stavros Niarchos did, Ludwig snapped, &#34;You can&#39;t carry oil in a grand piano.&#34; 15. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky. 16. The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. The Pmarca Blog Archive Ebook by Marc Andreessen (Founders #50) 17. The yacht was as much a business craft as any of his tankers and probably earned him more money than any of them. 18. Like the Rockefeller organization, Ludwig had mastered the practice of keeping his money by transferring it from one pocket, one company to another, while appearing to spend it. 19. He had learned something by now. Opportunities exist on the frontiers where most men dare not venture, and it is often the case that the farther the frontier, the greater the opportunity. 20. The way to escape competition is to either do something no one else is doing or do it where no one else is doing it. 21. Much of Ludwig&#39;s success was due to his willingness to venture where more timid entrepreneurs dared not go. ---- Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history&#39;s greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 17 at 1:45 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Todd Graves is one of my favorite living entrepreneurs. He&#39;s a great example of Charlie Munger&#39;s maxim: Find a simple idea and take it seriously. Todd wanted to create a quick service restaurant that only focused on quality chicken finger meals and nothing else. Everyone told him that couldn&#39;t possibly work. The college paper that described the idea that would turn into Raising Canes got the lowest grade in the class. Banks wouldn&#39;t loan him any money —but nothing could stop Todd from living out his &#34;chicken finger dream.&#34; He worked 95 hour weeks as a boilermaker, risked his life on a commercial fishing boat off the coast of Alaska, and scrounged up startup money from his bookie and a guy named Wild Bill. Todd made every mistake in the book, over leveraged himself, almost lost everything and yet he refused to give up or sell out. Today he has over 800 locations, 50,000 employees, and owns 90% of a business that&#39;s worth at least $10 billion. Todd&#39;s maxim is &#34;Do one thing and do it better than anyone else.&#34; Sources: Trading Secrets: Raising Cane’s founder Todd Graves reveals his path to building the wildly popular restaurant Theo Von: Raising Cane’s Founder Todd Graves ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

They sell obsolete and objectively inferior mechanical devices for 10-1000x the price of their superior digital successors… and demand is stronger than ever in history! Their products are comparable to a Hermès Birkin bag in price, luxury status and waitlist times… yet they produce over 1m units / year (roughly 10x annual Birkin production). They make the most universally recognized and desired Swiss watches… yet their founder wasn’t Swiss and didn’t start the company in Switzerland! If Rolex were publicly traded, they’d almost certainly be among the top 50 market cap companies in the world… yet they’re 100% owned by a charitable foundation in Geneva that (among other things) literally just gives away money to local people in the city.Tune in for one of the most fascinating and admirable companies we’ve ever covered on Acquired.

In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we most regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.Dr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025. Please enjoy!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

Founded in 1987 by the then-56 year old Morris Chang, already a legend in the semiconductor industry by virtue of his meteoric rise and fall at Texas Instruments, TSMC today manufactures nearly all the leading-edge chips for Nvidia, Apple, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, and yes — even Intel.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Michael Lewis gets a glimpse of sports gambling&#39;s future by talking with writers in Great Britain and Australia, where the industry is even more entrenched. But the US has its own peculiar history of failing to regulate dangerously addictive new products, and blaming the users instead. Especially when powerful industry advocates are able to pay scientists to sow doubt and delay the day of reckoning.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Has betting based on inside intel on games gone down since sports gambling was legalized in the US? Not really, as Michael Lewis finds out. But what&#39;s gone up is misery for athletes. We hear from Atlanta Hawks forward Larry Nance, Jr. about the rage, threats and wheedling that pro athletes now endure. The NCAA, former Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, is trying to protect student athletes on campus, while their friends all bet on them, often underaged. Overall, the “integrity landscape” for US sports looks more and more pot-holed by the day. For further reading: NCAA sports wagering surveySee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">IKEA may be the most singular company we’ve ever studied on Acquired. They’re a globally scaled, $50B annual revenue company with no direct competitors — yet have only ~5% market share. They’re one of the largest retailers in the world — yet sell only their own products. They generate a few billion in free cash flow every year — yet have no shareholders. And oh yeah, they also sell hot dogs cheaper than Costco! (Sort of.)Tune in for an episode flat-packed with counterintuitive lessons about how this folksy mail order business from the Swedish countryside came into your living rooms (and bedrooms and dining rooms and kitchens and bathrooms and patios and garages and backyards) all over the globe!Sponsors:Sentry: https://bit.ly/acquiredsentryServiceNow: https://bit.ly/acquiredsnHuntress: https://bit.ly/acqhuntressLinks:Please take our 2024 Acquired Survey if you have a minute.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Meta is a company everyone knows (literally, everyone). But, somehow, it’s also a company that few people feel they actually understand. Their products are used by more humans than any other’s in history — almost half of the entire world’s population daily. But… what is Meta? Why do they do what they do? How do they do what they do? Ask ten people and you’ll likely get ten very different sets of answers.Today, we dive deeper than we’ve ever gone trying to find Acquired’s answers to those questions. And after months of research and 6+ hours of incredible stories about how they (and really “they” being Mark himself) bet it all and win time and time again in the face of overwhelming odds, we arrive at our answers. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, AI, Oculus, Orion, it’s all here. Tune in for one of the greatest corporate stories of all time: Meta, a Mark Zuckerberg Production.

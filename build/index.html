                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">Today at 2:18 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">We sit down with Jamie Dimon for a live conversation at Radio City Music Hall, covering the incredible journey from his 1998 firing at Citgroup (where he was widely expected to become CEO) to building the most powerful bank in the world. Today JPMorgan Chase is a juggernaut — the most systemically important non-governmental financial institution in the world, with over twice the market capitalization of its nearest competitor. But it certainly wasn’t always this way! Jamie takes us from his career restart at the struggling Chicago-based Bank One through how he transformed that platform into the foundation for the modern JPMorgan Chase. We dive into the “fortress balance sheet” strategy that has defined his tenure, and cover blow-by-blow Jamie’s approach to the Great Financial Crisis, Bear Stearns, WaMu, First Republic and more. Tune in for an incredible conversation, live from New York City’s most iconic venue!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Summer ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">Yesterday at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When you think of the microbiome, you probably think of your gut. But bacteria live all over your body. And they’re incredibly numerous; you play host to about as many microbes — a hundred trillion of them — as you do human cells. As my guest will explain, these microbial ecosystems are not only ubiquitous but hugely influential for your health — impacting everything from your weight and mood to your risk of developing many diseases. Dr. Brett Finlay is a microbiologist and the co-author of The Microbiome Master Key. Today on the show, Brett explains what the microbiome is, how modern life — including our overemphasis on hygiene — has damaged it, and how the quality of your microbiome is connected to nine of the top ten leading causes of death, as well as everything from depression to Parkinson’s. Brett also shares how we can boost the health of our microbiome, including whether probiotic supplements are effective, how something as simple as flossing your teeth can cut your risk of Alzheimer’s by 50%, and why you might want to let your dog lick you in the face.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 14 at 4:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with psychologist and autism researcher Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen about the nature of empathy, systemizing, and the neurological basis of autism. This needed conversation explores how humans develop theory of mind, the differences between cognitive and affective empathy, and why some individuals gravitate toward systems over social interaction. They discuss the evolutionary roots of invention, gender differences in cognition, and how autistic traits relate to creativity and pattern recognition. Unflinchingly, they also discuss the darker side of empathy deficits—including psychopathy and cruelty—raising urgent questions about compassion, human development, and our capacity for evil. Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, Simon Baron-Cohen is Director of the Autism Research Centre and a global leader in autism research. He pioneered the &#39;mindblindness&#39; and &#39;empathizing-systemizing&#39; theories, has authored over 770 scientific papers, and was knighted in 2021 for his contributions to autism understanding. His work spans clinical practice, public education, and cutting-edge research on cognitive sex differences, empathy, and neurodiversity.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 13 at 1:03 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Your dad dies before you’re born. Your mom can’t afford to take care of you. You grow up without a family and in an institution. You learn a trade and start working full time at the age of 14. You work all day and go to school at night. You’re precise, meticulous, restless, and work circles around everyone. You’re promoted to run the factory at 18 but the thought of working for anyone else terrifies you. For your entire life you’ll be obsessed with control. You’ll do whatever it takes to escape the harshness of poverty and the pangs of hunger. You organize your life around a simple principle: &#34;I want to be the best at everything I do.” You start your own workshop, create the best product, and your biggest customer wants to become your partner. They underestimate you and abuse you. You destroy them. You take all of their customers. You’re not satisfied with being a subcontractor. You want everything. You make your own glasses, you buy your distributor, you list your company on the New York Stock Exchange, you complete hostile takeovers of much larger companies, you buy entire retail chains, and control everything about your product: from the raw materials to the relationship with the customer. Your competitors call you the hawk because you circle, wait, and then strike. You work 20 hours a day and fuse yourself with the factory. You get married four times, to three different women, and have six kids. You don’t look back, you don’t rest on your laurels, and you don’t go to sleep on wins. You make something great, then you do it again. Your biggest deal comes 60 years into your career. The only thing that could stop you was death. You are Leonardo Del Vecchio. This episode is what I learned from reading Leonardo Del Vecchio by Thomas Ebhardt and The Spectacle of Big Lens: How One Giant Company Will Dominate How the World Sees by Sam Knight. ------ ⁠Ramp⁠ gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 10 at 4:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this deeply personal interview, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Scott Adams, cartoonist and creator of Dilbert, to explore the unlikely paths that shape a life—from illustrating a nationally syndicated hit comic to fatal illness and facing the metaphysical. Adams shares stories of coincidence and perseverance, including how affirmations, setbacks, and sheer optimism propelled him from obscurity to national fame. The conversation dives into themes of malicious envy, systems versus goals, American culture, simulation theory, and the power of narrative perception. Both reflect on trauma, purpose, and survival—making this episode a profound meditation on how we author meaning in a truly absurd world.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 9 at 7:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">All the neurochemicals in the brain have to do with life in the present. Except for one: dopamine. Dopamine is the one neurochemical that looks to the future. It anticipates what may be to come and drives you towards it. That can be a good thing — dopamine is one powerful motivator — but it also has its downsides. Here to help us understand how the most important chemical in the brain works and how to deal with its pitfalls is Michael Long. Michael is a trained physicist turned writer whose latest book is Taming the Molecule of More. Mike and I discuss how dopamine, for better and worse, makes you want what you don&#39;t have. He shares what causes low dopamine activity, how to know if you&#39;re experiencing it, and what increases dopamine. We then talk about how to deal with the consequences of dopamine in some of the scenarios in which it plays a role — like losing the spark in a relationship and getting stuck in a smartphone scroll habit — and why so much of taming dopamine comes down to living in the here and now. We end our conversation with why The Great Gatsby is really a novel about dopamine and the fundamental answer to not letting the dopamine chase lead you around.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 7 at 7:38 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Sparked by French’s recent New York Times article, “The Democrats’ $20 Million Man Problem,” he and Jordan Peterson discuss the societal failures contributing to male alienation—fatherlessness, loss of purpose, overmedication, and a culture that increasingly pathologizes masculinity. French shares personal insights as a father, veteran, and conservative commentator (Who is regularly published in Liberal outlets), and the two expand on themes of demoralization, the need for intentional rites of passage, and the psychological appeal of figures like Andrew Tate. The conversation closes with a stark agreement—we urgently need to reach young men with empathy, structure, and a meaningful vision for life.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Your family asks you to take over a failing factory in a remote part of France. This “family business” comes with a stack of unpaid bills, a small team of workers who haven’t been paid in months, and a banker refusing to extend any more credit. You cut every unprofitable product and go all in on making rubber tires. You have no experience and don’t know a single thing about rubber manufacturing. You have a genius insight that selling tires is a waste of time and instead you should create the conditions for your product’s success. You organize the entire company around this core loop: encourage more driving → which leads to more movement → more movement leads to more wear → more wear leads to more tire sales. A simple and beautiful organizing principle emerges: a tire company will prosper if people travel more, so let’s help them do that. You make promiscuous use of the press. You write columns advertising the joys of the new activity of driving. You draw the maps, create the routes, and build thousands of road signs across France. All for free. Why? Because better signage means longer trips, more driving, and more tires sold. You publish the Michelin Guide — a free travel book with locations of hotels, restaurants, mechanics, and sites to see. You create the Michelin stars which become the global gold standard in fine dining and help people travel far for great food. You stimulate demand through spectacle. You sponsor races, airshows, and contests with cash prizes. You make smart bets early so by the time cars appear in large numbers you already own the roads. You create the most successful company mascot of all time and create a family dynasty that lasts 100 years. You&#39;re not one person, but two. André and Édouard Michelin, two brothers and one of the greatest cofounder teams in history. This episode is what I learned from reading Michelin: A Century of Secrets by Alain Germain and The Michelin Men: Driving an Empire by Herbert Lottman. ------ Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">July 1 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Note: This is a rebroadcast A lot of self-improvement advice and content feels empty. And there’s a reason for that. It often offers routines and habits to practice, but doesn’t offer a strong, overarching reason to practice them. That’s why the self-improvement advice of the Founding Fathers is particularly compelling. Though they were imperfect men, they had a clear why for trying to become better than they were. For the Founders, life was about the pursuit of happiness, and they equated happiness with excellence and virtue — a state that wasn’t about feeling good, but being good. The Founders pursued happiness not only for the personal benefit in satisfaction and tranquility it conferred, but for the way the attainment of virtue would benefit society as a whole; they believed that political self-government required personal self-government. Today on the show, Jeffrey Rosen, a professor of law, the president of the National Constitution Center, and the author of The Pursuit of Happiness, shares the book the Founders read that particularly influenced their idea of happiness as virtue and self-mastery. We talk about the schedules and routines the Founders kept, the self-examination practices they did to improve their character, and how they worked on their flaws, believing that, while moral perfection was ultimately an impossible goal to obtain, it was still something worth striving for.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 30 at 4:14 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan Peterson offers a psychological and cultural analysis of the Grimm Brothers&#39; Snow White, using it as a lens to explore evolutionary biology, female status hierarchies, fertility suppression, and the pathology of the “evil queen” archetype. Drawing on research in primatology and cultural commentary, Peterson connects ancient folklore to modern dynamics—critiquing contemporary feminist ideologies, careerism, and generational envy, while upholding the redemptive power of masculine responsibility in narrative tradition (and real life). Part myth, part science, part cultural autopsy—this is the synthesis of one of Peterson’s most impactful tenants: stories matter, and fundamental stories reiterate across time.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">We tell the story of the single greatest business ever created: Google search. From its origins as a Stanford research project called BackRub, Google became the front door to the internet. Today it’s an essential service for over half the world, and one that generates more profit than ANY other US company — more than Apple, Microsoft, or Berkshire Hathaway.But it wasn’t always so obvious. When Larry and Sergey began working on BackRub in 1996, search was a backwater industry in silicon valley. Existing search companies were eking out a living as vendors to the then-dominant “portals” like AOL and Yahoo. Google’s come-from-behind success was the result of three massive step-function leaps forward in algorithms, infrastructure and business model… some invented by Google and some borrowed (and perfected!) by them.Today, things are not so obvious once again for Google. Despite earning more profits than all of its big tech peers, its stock trades at significantly lower multiples — a $1 trillion or more discount to Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Investors are concerned that AI will render Google’s beautiful business model obsolete, even though Google also basically invented modern AI and continues to lead on many dimensions. This episode begins a multi-part series where we dive into the full history that led us to this point. Tune in and enjoy!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Summer ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

Riley shares how her decision to keep fighting for women’s sports and biological reality has only deepened since becoming pregnant with a daughter—and why she refuses to slow down.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 24 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When you’re feeling stressed, burnt out, and anxious — when you’re striving and achieving but still finding yourself persistently dissatisfied with life — you might start looking for answers beyond what’s offered by contemporary self-help. One ancient philosophy that can cast light on the sources of and solutions to our seemingly modern dilemmas is Buddhism. If you’ve ever been intrigued by Buddhism but admittedly only have a vague sense of what it’s all about, Brendan Barca — co-author of The Daily Buddhist: 366 Days of Mindful Living — will walk you through its foundational principles. We begin our conversation with how Buddhism is similar to and different from other ancient philosophies like Stoicism, and Brendan offers an accessible introduction to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. In the second half of our conversation, we explore how Buddhist principles and practices can be applied to our everyday modern lives and help you deal with the anxiety created by living in an impermanent world, shift your perspective on daily challenges, and cultivate greater compassion and patience. We discuss different meditation methods, the real purpose of meditation, and how to get started with it as a beginner. We end our conversation with the Buddha’s final words and what it means to “strive with vigilance.”</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 23 at 6:46 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">You take over the family pastry shop and transform it into one of the most valuable privately held businesses in the world. Your father dies young. Your uncle does too. Everyone is relying on you and this keeps you up at night. You insist on differentiation and refuse to make me too products. You obsess over quality. You run tens of thousands of experiments. The products you invent will sell successfully for decades. You shroud your entire operation in secrecy. You study your competitors but never tell them what you’re doing. You go to great — almost absurd — lengths to control everything about your business. You have no outside shareholders and no debt. You commute by helicopter so you can perform quality control in person. You insist on constant customer contact and invent new ways to collect information from the customers you obsess over. You build your own machines, control all of your raw materials, and invest so heavily in distribution and logistics that you own the largest private fleet of vehicles in Italy, second only to the Italian army. You love your business and don’t want to spend time doing anything else. When you propose to your wife you tell her that she is marrying a man who will always talk to her about chocolate. You believe creating wealth is a moral duty. You are Michele Ferrero. This episode is what I learned from reading Michele Ferrero by Salvatore Giannella. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform. Make history&#39;s greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to Ramp and learning how they can help your business control your costs and save time and money. ----- Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book ---- Episode highlights: We create mythical products that create markets. If a market is interesting, we must become the leader. The product is put at the center of everything. All of the company&#39;s activities must revolve around it. He would repeat: If you want to go bankrupt just listen to everybody. He insisted that all shares remain in the family. He never wanted to have to justify his choices to anyone. He insisted on continuous innovation, the refusal of repetition of the already known, the search for new paths, and the opening of new horizons by differentiating from others. One of his favorite metaphors: A good entrepreneur must be like a good skeet shooter: hitting the target by aiming not at the launch station, but further ahead—always with a long-term vision. Control everything you can – ingredients, process, technology – to safeguard quality and trade secrets. For me work is a spiritual necessity. I was accustomed to it from a young age and couldn&#39;t do without it. Focus on making well-crafted, high-quality products, and the rest will follow. I was able to do all this because of being a family business. This allowed us to grow calmly, to have long term plans, to know how to wait, and to not be caught up in the frenzy of the daily ups and downs. Mrs. Valeria (the name he gave to his customers) is the mistress of it all, the CEO, the one who can decide your success or your demise, the one you have to respect, never betray, and understand completely. He said that doing good for others is doing good for oneself. Michele Ferrero seemed to possess a genuine, childlike passion for bringing joy through his creations. He couldn’t resist spending time in the laboratory, dreaming up new delights. He was known to work through Sundays and even overnight, feverishly experimenting to perfect a flavor or texture. Our identity is based on our independence. If we had shareholders they would ask us to increase turnover. But it takes time to make a good product. Many of the machines were invented and built in-house by Ferrero’s own engineering department. Ferrero pursued perfection with monastic devotion.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this live lecture from Omaha, Nebraska, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson weaves through biblical narratives and cultural critique—from Tolstoy’s suicidal despair to Moses’ encounter with the burning bush, from Cain’s failed sacrifice to James Bond as the symbol of romantic adventure. What do these stories have in common? What happens when we replace transcendent pursuit with technological pride or ideological dogma? This is a warning—and a call—to speak the truth, take up your cross, and climb. This “We Who Wrestle With God” tour stop was filmed in Omaha, NE, on October 21st, 2024.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">What if the traits you’ve been taught to suppress your entire career are actually the very qualities that separate those who get what they want from those who stay stuck waiting for recognition that never comes? Today on the show, Jenny Wood argues that most of us are living in what she calls “an invisible cage” created by an overabundance of caution, and that the biggest lie you’ve been told in your career is to keep your head down and let your work speak for itself. Jenny is a former Google executive who developed a career development program used by 56,000 people in nearly 100 countries, and she’s the author of Wild Courage: Go After What You Want and Get It. In our conversation, Jenny explains how traits that have a negative rap can be used for positive ends that will advance your career. We discuss how being shameless, reckless, nosy, manipulative, obsessed, and more can help you overcome your success-hindering fears, take bolder action, and achieve your goals.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this powerful lecture from the We Who Wrestle With God tour, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson explores why stories aren&#39;t just entertainment—but the essential structure through which we perceive reality, aim toward meaning, and shape our lives. From biblical archetypes to everyday struggles, Peterson weaves a compelling argument that our suffering, identity, and moral choices are all governed by the stories we believe and the sacrifices we&#39;re willing to make. Drawing on deep psychological insight and ancient wisdom, he reveals that without a unifying aim, we drift toward bitterness and chaos—but with the right sacrifice, we forge a path toward meaning, community, and spiritual alignment. This “We Who Wrestle With God” tour stop was filmed in Reading, PA on October 14th, 2024.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">You grow up in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn. You drop out of college. Your dad is your best friend but you don’t want to work the docks like him. You’re determined to “do something special.” You get a job sweeping the floor at recording studio. You get fired—twice. You’ll do anything to work in the music business, including working on Easter Sunday. That’s how you meet John Lennon. This is the day your life begins. You focus on being of service. You stay in the room and in the saddle. Bruce Springsteen teaches you what work ethic really means. You work with Tom Petty, Bono, Patti Smith, Stevie Nicks, and countless others. You’ll produce hundreds of songs. You get restless, start a family, and start a record company. You get advice from David Geffen. You figure out your edge is producing the producers. You work with the absolute best, hand them the keys, and tell them to drive. You’re a scrapper, you’re persistent, you use fear as a tailwind, you keep the main thing the main thing, you work all the time, you put 100% into whatever is in front of you. You’re described as fiercely competitive, insanely driven, and brilliant. You can never turn it off and you don’t understand why everyone else isn’t like that too. You start multiple companies, make billions of dollars, and tell the best stories when you go on podcasts after you retire. You are Jimmy Iovine. This episode is what I learned from rewatching the documentary The Defiant Ones and listening to these excellent interviews with Jimmy Iovine. ----- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris explore the breakdown of institutions in the digital age, and how difficult it’s become to identify what’s true and what’s not. Harris voices deep concern over the role independent media and social platforms play in amplifying misinformation, especially post-October 7th. They discuss the addictive, fragmenting nature of platforms like X, the erosion of trust in institutions, the dangers of AI-generated identity theft — and possible solutions. The result is a sobering analysis of epistemic collapse, digital psychopathy, and the urgent need for institutional structure in a world where mass information fails us. &#39;This episode was filmed on June 6th, 2025. | Links | For Sam Harris: On X https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/?hl=en On Youtube https://www.youtube.com/@samharrisorg Substack https://samharris.substack.com/ The Waking Up App https://www.wakingup.com/</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 10 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When Rick Burgess was growing up, his father, Bill Burgess, was also his football coach. But Bill was a mentor on and off the field not only for his own son but for the many young men he coached at both the high school and collegiate level. Though Bill has passed on, his lessons remain timeless and valuable for all men. Today on the show, Rick shares some of his old-school wisdom with us. Rick is a radio host, a men&#39;s ministry leader, and the author of Men Don&#39;t Run in the Rain: A Son&#39;s Reflections on Life, Faith, and an Iconic Father. In our conversation, he discusses what his dad taught him through football and beyond, including why men don&#39;t run in the rain and why you need to get out of the stands, avoid being stupid, refuse to rest on your laurels, understand the difference between confidence and arrogance, and take full responsibility for your life without making excuses. We also talk about how Rick drew upon his father&#39;s wisdom when tragedy struck his life.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">What I Got Wrong About Going Analog</h5>
                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 10 at 7:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode, I share my thoughts on the evolving meaning of “rewilding” my illustration process. Originally, rewilding meant bringing analog elements back into my work—inking on paper, scanning textures, doing things the “hard” way. But lately, I’ve been asking myself: is it really about going analog? Or is it about something deeper? In this episode, I unpack how rewilding is less about tools and more about mindset. I look at how digital tools can either suffocate or support our creativity, depending on how we use them. And I share how I’m finding spontaneity, joy, and pride in my work—even when it’s 100% digital.If you’ve ever felt disconnected from your creative process, or worried about how AI and digital tools are affecting your style, this episode is for you.I also share some reflections on the Amish, digital minimalism, and why your mechanical pencil will never ask you to rate it on the App Store.IN THIS EPISODEWhy rewilding might be a mindset, not a mediumHow digital tools can both hinder and help creative joyWhat I’ve rediscovered about spontaneity, surprise, and storytelling in illustrationWhy pride in your process matters—and how to get it backHow AI is forcing illustrators to reevaluate their processThe three key questions I now ask to evaluate any creative toolPLUS – Why my Apple Pencil will never beat a Mason jar full of ink water.SHOW LINKSDrawing Ideas (Skillshare Class) — https://www.tomfroese.com/teaching/drawingideasPost by @brettpstenson — https://www.instagram.com/p/DKiYMKHSapr/?img_index=1See How Book Artwork Was Done In The Old Days Before Computers — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5YoyBvX1f8Graphic Design Tools Before Photoshop — https://youtu.be/O-XrRQf7BPM?si=GqEeaFOWfW3A87LlMy early style (Tom Froese Postcard example) — https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5aa6d6c0a9e028fce5f7f4b2/1523840966237-XPQXSOX8HCUS9WI1SEDW/Tom+Froese+Stationery-3.jpgMy style a few years ago (totally digital) — https://www.tomfroese.com/work/canadianidentityMy more recent style (more rewilded, in spite of being all digital) — https://www.instagram.com/p/DJr4MSTyTTv/ (image for my upcoming book, Drawing is Important).HOW TO SUPPORTShare this episode with your friends!Like / Subscribe / Follow / Comment / Review on Apple PodcastsBecome a $3 Supporter or $8 Drawing Buddy on Patreon – patreon.com/tomfroeseBECOME A DRAWING BUDDYLive, monthly Draw With Me meetupsAll past DWMs available as replaysExclusive access to the DWM Discord ServerJoin hereFIND ME ELSEWHEREWork and ClassesInstagramDaily DrawingsCREDITSMusic and Cues by Mark Allan Falk – semiathletic on Linktree</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">I&#39;ve read this interview probably 10 times. It&#39;s that good. Steve Jobs was 29 when this interview was published, and with remarkable clarity of thought Steve explains the upcoming technological revolution, why the personal computer is the greatest tool humans have ever invented, how the computer compares to past inventions, why software needs to be simplified (You shouldn&#39;t have to read a novel to write a novel!) why the future is always exciting and unpredictable, what soul in the game looks like and why his competitors don&#39;t have any, why slightly insane people are the ones who make great products, the importance of questioning things and how doing so produces novel insights, why it&#39;s dangerous to have layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work, the importance of hiring troublemakers, why more people should aspire to be like Edwin Land, and how if he every leaves Apple he will always come back.

The petrochemical revolution gave us free energy—free mechanical energy, in this case. It changed the texture of society in most ways. This revolution, the information revolution, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy. This revolution will dwarf the petrochemical revolution. We’re on the forefront. A computer is the most incredible tool we’ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a supercalculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer. We have no idea how far it’s going to go The hard part of what we’re up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can’t tell them. A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked Alexander Graham Bell, “What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?” he wouldn’t have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world. He didn’t know that people would use the telephone to call up and find out what movies were playing that night or to order some groceries or call a relative on the other side of the globe. That is what Macintosh is all about. It’s the first “telephone” of our industry. Ad campaigns are necessary for competition; IBM’s ads are everywhere. But good PR educates people; that’s all it is. You can’t con people in this business. The products speak for themselves. We didn’t build Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through. The people in the Mac group wanted to build the greatest computer that has ever been seen.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">June 3 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">That Dwight D. Eisenhower became Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, orchestrating the largest amphibious invasion in history on June 6, 1944, was far from inevitable. He came from the middle of nowhere — Abilene, Kansas — had never led men in battle, spent most of his career as a staff officer, and didn’t make general until he was in his fifties. How, then, did he become the leader on whom the fate of the world would rest? Today, we trace the making of Ike with Michel Paradis, author of The Light of Battle. We talk about how Eisenhower’s Midwestern upbringing shaped his character, and how his most important education happened outside the classroom. Michel shares how crucial mentors were in Ike’s development, and how Eisenhower made the most of those relationships. We discuss the books that were most formative in shaping his thinking, including what he got from Nietzsche. We also get into some of the practices Eisenhower used to lead effectively, including how he budgeted his time to maintain his morale while under the pressure of planning D-Day and what he did the evening before the invasion to deal with the stress.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">We sit down with Steve Ballmer, the legendary former Microsoft CEO and owner of the LA Clippers, for an epic conversation covering his 34 years at Microsoft. Steve listened to our Microsoft episodes and had some thoughts to share — and boy, did he deliver. Steve takes us point-by-point through the original IBM DOS deal that started everything, how he built Microsoft&#39;s enterprise business from scratch, and offers his candid reflections on missing mobile and search. We also cover the story behind “developers, developers, developers”, the complexities of his relationship with Bill Gates (including a year where they didn&#39;t speak), and why he ultimately decided to step down as CEO. Plus, we learn why Steve has held onto his Microsoft stock through it all — giving him arguably the best investment track record in the world over the last 10 years with his net worth growing from $20B to $130B since leaving. And of course, we couldn&#39;t resist also talking about his other passion: the Clippers and Intuit Dome.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 27 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">The British just seem like a classier bunch. Part of it is that winning accent. But it&#39;s also because English culture has long been steeped in the tradition of learning and practicing etiquette. Here to share some of the essentials of modern etiquette that are important no matter which side of the pond you live on is William Hanson, a British etiquette expert and the author of Just Good Manners. William shares the difference between manners and etiquette, and why young people are especially interested in both. He then takes us through how to introduce yourself and others, the history behind the &#34;no elbows on the table&#34; mantra, the rules of small talk, some overlooked guidelines for table manners, how to enter a conversational circle at a party, considerations for elevator etiquette, and much more. Whether you&#39;re dining at a fancy restaurant or just want to navigate social situations with more confidence, William&#39;s insights will help you present yourself with the panache of a proper English gentleman.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 26 at 1:14 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When Tamara Mellon’s father lent her the seed money to start a high-end shoe company, he cautioned her: “Don’t let the accountants run your business.” Little did he know that over the next fifteen years, the struggle between “financial” and “creative” would become one of the central themes as Mellon’s business. Mellon grew Jimmy Choo into a billion dollar brand and her personal glamour made her an object of global media fascination. Vogue photographed her wedding. Vanity Fair covered her divorce and the criminal trial that followed. The Wall Street Journal reported on her relentless battle between “the suits” and “the creatives&#34; and Mellon’s triumph against a brutally hostile takeover attempt. But despite her eventual fame and fortune, Mellon didn’t have an easy road to success. Her early life was marked by a tumultuous and broken family life, battles with anxiety and depression, and a stint in rehab. Determined not to end up unemployed, penniless, and living in her parents’ basement under the control of her alcoholic mother, Mellon honed her natural business sense and invested in what she knew best—fashion. In creating the shoes that became a fixture on Sex and the City and red carpets around the world, Mellon relied on her own impeccable sense of what the customer wanted—because she was that customer. What she didn’t know at the time was that success would come at a high price—after struggles with an obstinate business partner, a conniving first CEO, a turbulent marriage, and a mother who tried to steal her hard-earned wealth. Now Mellon shares the whole larger-than-life story, with shocking details that have never been presented before. From her troubled childhood to her time as a young editor at Vogue to her partnership with the cobbler Jimmy Choo, to her very public relationships, Mellon offers an honest and gripping account of the episodes that have made her who she is today. In My Shoes is a definitive book for fashion aficionados, aspiring entrepreneurs, and anyone who loves a juicy true story about sex, drugs, money, power, high heels, and overcoming adversity. This episode is what I learned from reading In My Shoes: A Memoir by Tamara Mellon. ----- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 20 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Uncertainty is a constant of human existence. How will market conditions affect your new business venture? What will be the results of the medical test you just took? Will a new relationship work out? For most of us, situations of uncertainty trigger anxiety, even fear. But the stress of uncertainty doesn&#39;t have to overwhelm you. You can learn to navigate it with secure, adaptable confidence so you can keep thriving and progress towards your ultimate goals. Today on the show, Rich Diviney, a retired Navy SEAL commander, returns to share insights from his new book Masters of Uncertainty. He first explains why thinking that life will be predictable keeps people from realizing their potential. He then walks us through practical techniques for dealing with uncertainty like &#34;moving horizons,&#34; creating meaningful goals that work with our brain chemistry, and de-stressing your body so you can be more resilient and make better decisions under pressure. We also discuss how understanding your unique attributes will help you understand how you react to uncertainty and how teams can implement &#34;dynamic subordination&#34; to adapt in rapidly changing environments.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 15 at 8:08 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">(I fixed the audio and uploaded a new episode!) &#34;To read Jeff Bezos’s shareholder letters is to get a crash course in running a high-growth internet business from someone who mastered it before any of the playbooks were written.&#34; That is the best description of Bezos&#39;s letters I have ever read. I just finished rereading these letters for the 4th or 5th time. With clear thinking and ferocious intelligence, Bezos provides a masterclass in building a customer-obsessed, enduring franchise. With relentless repetition Bezos teaches us about the importance of invention, risk-taking, wandering, differentiation, technology, judgement, high-standards, customer obsession, long-term orientation, and why value trumps everything. Read the letters on Amazon&#39;s website here. Or in the book Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos Register for the live event in New York at Ramp! Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform. Make history&#39;s greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to Ramp and learning how they can help your business control your costs and save time and money. Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book ( 15:00 ) Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon success. It&#39;s not easy to work here but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren&#39;t meant to be easy. ( 24:00 ) We believe we have reached a &#34;tipping point,&#34; where this platform allows us to launch new ecommerce businesses faster, with a higher quality of customer experience, a lower incremental cost, a higher chance of success, and a faster path to scale and profitability than any other company. ( 27:00 ) We will continue to invest heavily in introductions to new customers. Though it&#39;s sometimes hard to imagine with all that has happened in the last five years, this remains Day 1 for ecommerce, and these are the early days of category formation where many customers are forming relationships for the first time. We must work hard to grow the number of customers who shop with us. ( 37:00 ) Focus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford to lower prices, which drives growth. Growth spreads fixed costs across more sales, reducing cost per unit, which makes possible more price reductions. Customers like this, and it&#39;s good for shareholders. Please expect us to repeat this loop. ( 47:00 ) Our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years or more. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon. ( 55:00 ) Our fundamental approach remains the same. Stay heads down, focused on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long-term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn&#39;t otherwise contemplate. Seek instant gratification and chances are you&#39;ll find a crowd there ahead of you. ( 56:00 ) Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution. ( 59:00 ) Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers. ( 1:00:00 ) A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it&#39;s durable in time-with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these get married. ( 1:02:00 ) We all know that if you swing for the fences, you&#39;re going to strike out a lot, but you&#39;re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score one thousand runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it&#39;s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments. ( 1:10:00) When a memo isn&#39;t great, it&#39;s not the writer&#39;s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They&#39;re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we&#39;re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can&#39;t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope-that a great memo probably should take a week or more. ( 1:12:00 ) Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you&#39;re going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute. In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient-but it&#39;s also not random. It&#39;s guided-by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it&#39;s worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there. Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries-the &#34;nonlinear&#34; ones-are highly likely to require wandering. ---- Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history&#39;s greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 13 at 7:06 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode, I share my conversation with Roberts Rurans, a Latvia-based illustrator who creates all his work using traditional materials — literally painting his images with acrylics. When Roberts talks about his brushes, he means the actual ones lying on his table, not virtual tools in a menu! His process is physical, full of quirks, accidents, and unexpected moments — and yet, his work feels fresh and totally at home in today’s digital illustration landscape.Roberts has worked with clients like Hermès, Nike, Apple, and Coca-Cola, but his artistic integrity shines through no matter the project. In our conversation, we talk about evolving your style, the tension between old and new work, the difference between art and design, and what it’s really like to work 100% analog in a mostly digital world.Toward the end, Roberts answers questions submitted by my Patreon supporters — including whether he secretly uses any digital tools (you’ll have to listen to find out). I wrap things up with some community notes and another “Embarrassing Story of the Episode,” featuring me, a trail run, some hikers caught unawares, and a well-placed band-aid.IN THIS EPISODEHow Roberts Rurans keeps his fully analog style feeling freshThoughts on evolving your style without disowning the pastThe line between art and design in illustrationAnalog tools vs. digital tools — which gives you the edge?PLUS - Embarrassing Moment of the Episode: Shirtless in the ForestSHOW LINKSRoberts Rurans on Instagram – https://www.instagram.com/robertsruransRoberts’s website – https://www.robertsrurans.comHOW TO SUPPORTShare this episode with your friends!Like/Subscribe/Follow/Comment/ReviewBecome a $3 Supporter or $8 Drawing Buddy on Patreon.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 13 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Community is one of life&#39;s most valuable but increasingly scarce resources. While we hear about a supposed epidemic of male loneliness, many men still resist joining groups or struggle to maintain involvement after initial enthusiasm wanes. Today on the show, Frank Schwartz will help us understand the barriers to building male community and how to overcome them. Frank is the CEO of F3, a free, all-volunteer men&#39;s leadership organization that uses workouts to bring men together and supports hundreds of decentralized chapters worldwide. In the first half of our conversation, Frank explains the psychology behind men&#39;s hesitation to join groups, how to navigate the &#34;wish dream&#34; of idealized community, and why expecting perfection kills participation. We then discuss what makes leadership in a decentralized group different from traditional hierarchies, the importance of embracing messiness, and why allowing men to make their own decisions creates stronger leaders than giving them a rulebook to follow. We end our conversation with Frank&#39;s perspective on cultivating patience as a leader and how to measure success when building a community of men.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 1 at 8:30 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Jim Simons never took a single class on finance, wasn’t interested in business, and didn’t start trading full time until he was 40. The company he founded — Renaissance Technologies — has made over $100 billion in profits. Starting out with the heretical belief that there was a hidden structure in financial markets, Jim decided to staff his “crazy hedge fund” with mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists. He went to great lengths to collect more historic financial data than anyone else, spent a lot of time recruiting “killers” (people with single minded focus that wouldn’t quit), invested heavily in computers (and the people who ran them), and designed the most collaborative work environment. Jim was a world-class mathematician, code breaker, exceptional manager of people with exceptional minds, a genius in system design, and deeply understood the power of incentives. He was also incapable of giving up, willing to endure a decade of struggle and pain, and hell-bent on doing something “historic” with his life. Jim Simons lived a life defined by persistence, unconventional thinking, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. Studying his life and work is time well spent. This episode is what I learned from rereading The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode I talk about why it’s so hard to make digital art look more natural. For many of us, we work digitally out of convenience but really want our work to have a more analogue appearance — as though it were made using physical media. I explain why this is harder than you might think, citing 3 key factors I’ve encountered in my own experience. Then, I offer 5 more practical ways you can overcome these challenges and make your work look more natural. Stick around to the end where I try a new segment called “The Embarrassing Story of the Episode”!NOTE: I accidentally published this episode a day early and now I can&#39;t take it back.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Greg Zuckerman is an award-winning Special Writer at the Wall Street Journal and the author of several books on financial firms, hedge funds, trading, and other investing and business-related topics. This podcast focuses on trading and the fierce competition individuals face when attempting to trade against sophisticated hedge funds that employ the best and brightest mathematical minds in the business. We discuss Greg&#39;s book, The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution. Rick Ferri, CFA, a long-time Boglehead and investment adviser, hosts the Bogleheads on Investing podcast. The Bogleheads are a group of like-minded individual investors who follow the general investment and business beliefs of John C. Bogle, founder and former CEO of the Vanguard Group. It is a conflict-free community where individual investors reach out and provide education, assistance, and relevant information to other investors of all experience levels at no cost. The organization supports a free forum at Bogleheads.org, and the wiki site is Bogleheads® wiki. Since 2000, the Bogleheads have held national conferences in major cities nationwide. Local Chapters in the US and a few foreign chapters meet regularly. New Chapters are added regularly. All Bogleheads activities are coordinated by volunteers who contribute their time and talent.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 22 at 7:58 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Akio Morita was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Sony. Born as the first son and fifteenth-generation heir to a 300-year-old sake-brewing family in Japan, Akio eschewed the traditional path to forge his own legacy in electronics. In post-war Japan, Akio joined forces with Masaru Ibuka to found Sony. They started in a burned-out department store with limited resources—to build their first product they had to buy supplies on the black market. Akio was determined to change the global perception of Japanese goods as poor quality. From day one he set out to build high-quality, differentiated products, targeted at affluent markets. Akio believed in long-term vision over short-term profits, product innovation without market research, and brand building over immediate profits. Against all opposition, including inside of his own company, Akio invented one of the most successful consumer products of all time: The Walkman. It sold over 400 million units and inspired countless other entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, James Dyson, and Phil Knight. This episode is what I learned from rereading Akio&#39;s classic 1986 autobiography Made In Japan. ---- Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">What if we told you that the most important company in US healthcare was run from a farm in rural Wisconsin? And that farm contained the world’s largest subterranean auditorium, as well as Disneyland—style replicas of Hogwarts and the Emerald City? What if we told you that the person who started, runs and owns this establishment has legally ensured that it will never be sold, never go public and never acquire another company? And that this person, Judy Faulkner, is also likely the wealthiest and most successful self-made woman in history?Welcome to the story of Epic Systems, the software company that underpins the majority of the American healthcare system today. Epic isn’t “just” an electronic medical record (the category it’s usually lumped into), or an online patient portal (which is how most of the US population interacts with it via its MyChart application). It’s more akin to a central nervous system for hospitals and health clinics. Almost everything in a hospital — from patient interactions to billing, staffing, scheduling, prescriptions and even research — happens on Epic’s platform, and over 90% of American medical schools’ graduating doctors, nurses and health administrative staff are trained on it during their educations.

The IPL is currently valued at $16B, with a TV rights deal that’s higher in per-match dollars than the NBA and the English Premier League. And all this for a league that’s right now just 10 teams who collectively only play 74 total games per season… and oh yeah, the whole thing is only 17 years old!

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Is anyone trying to regulate sports gambling on the federal level in the US? In the fall of 2024, Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill with New York Congressman Paul Tonko. The SAFE Bet would restrict sports gambling ads and would help fund more gambling addiction treatment, among other things. Blumenthal speaks with Michael Lewis about why he sees sports gambling as a public health disaster in the making.

In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we most regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.Dr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025. Please enjoy!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

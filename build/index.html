                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with the new leader of the UK Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch. They discuss her multinational upbringing, how that informed her on the fallacies of multiculturalism, the necessary preconditions of a functioning society, the current political landscape of the UK, and why anger resonates - but cannot rebuild. The Rt Hon Kemi Badenoch was Secretary of State for the Department for Business and Trade between 7 February 2023 and 5 July 2024. She was Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade between 6 September 2022 and 4 July 2024, and Minister for Women and Equalities for the Equality Hub between 25 October 2022 and 4 July 2024.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">February 13 at 9:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, ex-professor, and public advocate, Matthew Goodwin. They discuss the systemic rot of the academic institutions, how the West has been subjugated by long-term mass radicalization, why the elites rally behind far-left progressivism, the grotesque extent of UK r*pe gang scandal, and (if not obvious) exactly why we won’t be quiet about it regardless of what Keir Starmer would prefer. Matt Goodwin is a disillusioned university professor who stepped away from a tenured position last year to get more involved in politics and the public debate. He has the largest Substack in the UK, presents the TV Show State of the Nation on GB News, is the author of six books, including two national bestsellers, and has many followers on social media in the UK and across Europe.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">February 11 at 11:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">A lot of people go into marriage with a 50/50 mindset. Everything in the relationship — from tangible things like childcare and chores to intangible things like the effort and energy needed to keep the partnership going — is supposed to be divided equally. The 50/50 approach to relationships is all about fairness. And that seems sensible and rational. But, my guest says, it actually sabotages relational happiness. Nate Klemp is a former philosophy professor and the co-author, along with his wife, of The 80/80 Marriage: A New Model for a Happier, Stronger Relationship. Today on the show, Nate shares how cognitive biases skew our perception of our contributions to a relationship, what happens when couples get stuck in the 50/50 mindset of domestic scorekeeping, and how shifting to an 80/80 model of “radical generosity” can create an upward spiral of connection and appreciation. And we discuss practical ways to divide household responsibilities, decide how much time to spend with each spouse’s respective parents, and establish values that will guide your partnership as you navigate life changes and work towards a spirit of shared success.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Is anyone trying to regulate sports gambling on the federal level in the US? In the fall of 2024, Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill with New York Congressman Paul Tonko. The SAFE Bet would restrict sports gambling ads and would help fund more gambling addiction treatment, among other things. Blumenthal speaks with Michael Lewis about why he sees sports gambling as a public health disaster in the making.

They discuss the epidemic of insulin resistance in America and its profound effects on health, the sugar addiction crisis, how dopamine hijacks your brain, how to navigate the American diet, and the potential to fix it invitationally from the top down over the next four years. Benjamin Bikman earned a Ph.D. in bioenergetics at East Carolina University with a focus on the adaptations to metabolic surgeries in obesity. He continued to explore metabolic disorders, with a particular focus on insulin resistance, as a postdoctoral fellow at the Duke-National University of Singapore.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Your father goes bankrupt. You work for 50 cents a day to try to help your family survive the Great Depression. At 19 you see an opportunity where others see nothing. You start “a little fuel delivery business” with one used truck. Five years later you have 10 trucks. World War II breaks out and you serve as the fuel supply officer for General Patton. You come back to America and apply what the war taught you about logistics and moving fuel efficiently. You expand from fuel delivery to storage, refining, and open gas stations in 16 states. You take your company public. You merge with an oil exploration firm. You build the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere. You buy the New York Jets. You built your “little fuel delivery business” into a multibillion-dollar, multinational, vertically integrated energy behemoth. You are Leon Hess, founder of the Hess family dynasty. This episode is what I learned from reading Hess: The Last Oil Baron by Tina Davis and Jessica Resnick-Ault.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">February 4 at 11:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">For several decades, people&#39;s reported sleep quality has declined. This, despite the fact that specially optimized sheets, mattresses, and sleep trackers have emerged during that time, and despite the fact that the amount of time people are sleeping hasn&#39;t decreased for over fifty years. In other words, people aren&#39;t sleeping less than they used to, but are less happy about their sleep than ever before. My guest would say that to improve our experience of sleep, we&#39;d be better off looking past the reams of modern advice out there and back in time — way, way back in time. Today on the show, Dr. Merijn van de Laar, a recovering insomniac, sleep therapist, and the author of How toSleep Like a Caveman: Ancient Wisdom for a Better Night&#39;s Rest, will tell us how learning about our prehistoric ancestors&#39; sleep can help us relax about our own. He explains that the behaviors we think of as sleep problems are actually normal, natural, and even adaptive. We talk about why hunter-gatherers actually sleep less than we think we need to, how their natural wake periods during the night might explain our own sleep patterns, the methods they use to get better sleep, and why our modern efforts to optimize sleep could be making it worse. Merijn shares when it&#39;s okay to use a smartphone before bed, the myth that you have to get eight hours of sleep a night, how to intentionally use sleep deprivation to improve your sleep, and more.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Peterson’s third biblical series, “The Gospels” is part of his lifelong effort to rescue society from the meaning crisis that seeks to devour our culture. In this series, Peterson gathers nine of the world&#39;s most brilliant minds to unravel the mysteries of the Gospel stories and to resurrect the anchoring principles of the text that formed the West. Today, we are releasing episode 1 of this revolutionary but tradition-grounded series. The episode stands on its own but also serves as an introduction to the rest of the ten, two-hour long seminars available exclusively on DailyWire+. The Daily Wire and Dr. Peterson both hope that you will consider a subscription to DailyWire+, where you can view the Gospel seminar and their other collaborations in their entirety. This includes &#34;Exodus&#34; and &#34;Foundations of the West,&#34; as well as his life-altering series that address marriage, how to become successful, developing a vision, the importance of masculinity, and overcoming depression and anxiety. Thank you for your time, attention, and continued support of both Dr. Peterson’s work and his partnership with The Daily Wire. Explore the full catalog here: dailywire.com/watch/jordan-peterson A special thanks to Bishop Robert Barron, Dr. Stephen Blackwood, Dr. Douglas Hedley, Gregg Hurwitz, Konstantin Kisin, Dr. James Orr, Jonathan Pageau, Dr. Dennis Prager, and Dr. John Vervaeke for joining Dr. Peterson and the audience on this journey.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Jordan Peterson sits down with author and co-founder of Truvani, Vani Hari. They discuss Hari’s personal struggles with food which led her to start the Food Babe blog, the disgraceful business practices of major food companies, how the Tobacco industry took over big food, the unimaginable progress made just recently via the MAHA movement, and where this new surge of hope leads us - should we choose to follow. Vani Hari is a food activist, a NY Times best-selling author of 4 books, co-founder of the organic food brand Truvani, and was named one of the “Most Influential People on the Internet” by Time magazine. Hari started FoodBabe.com to spread information about what is really in the American food supply. She teaches people how to make the right purchasing decisions at the grocery store, how to live an organic lifestyle, and how to travel healthfully around the world. Vani has influenced how major food giants like Kraft, Subway, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, and Starbucks create their products, steering them towards more healthful policies.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">There has been a lot of cultural discussion of the way digital technologies and social media contribute to things like political polarization and adolescent depression. But as I&#39;ll explore with Nicholas Carr, the author of Superbloom, our digital tools are also changing our ability to connect with others and our sense of self in less appreciated ways. Today on the show, Nicholas unpacks why the optimistic idea that more communication is always better hasn&#39;t panned out and how the speed and volume of modern communication is overwhelming our human capacity to process information and maintain meaningful relationships. We discuss why the &#34;messiness&#34; of pre-digital communication might have actually been better for us, how email has evolved from thoughtful letters to rushed messages, and why seeing more of people online often makes us like them less. Nicholas also explains why having different versions of ourselves for different contexts was actually healthy and the simple rubric for better managing our relationship with digital communication tools.</p>

This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we most regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.Dr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Marcus Wallenberg Jr&#39;s impact on Swedish industry was so substantial that during the 1970s, Wallenberg family businesses employed about 40% of Sweden&#39;s industrial workforce and represented 40% of the total worth of the Stockholm stock market. The Wallenberg family is one of the most fascinating family dynasties you could read about. The family has survived — and continues to thrive — for 170 years. In a family full of talented entrepreneurs and investors Marcus Wallenberg Jr. stands out. This episode is what I learned from reading Furthering A Fortune: Marcus Wallenberg Swedish Banker and Industrialist by Ulf Olsson.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When people get stuck in their job or personal life, the common response is to either work harder or shrug and accept that &#34;that&#39;s just the way things are.&#34; My guest today has a much better solution to getting moving and making progress again. Dan Heath is a bestselling author whose latest book is Reset: How to Change What&#39;s Not Working. Today on the show, Dan shares how to escape from ineffective systems and the inertia of continuing to do things the way they&#39;ve always been done by pressing on leverage points — places where a little bit of effort yields disproportionate returns. Dan explains why you need &#34;to go and see the work,&#34; why meaningful change requires &#34;restacking resources,&#34; how short, focused &#34;bursts&#34; of effort often accomplish more than prolonged campaigns, how sometimes being inefficient can actually make us more effective, and more. Along the way, Dan shares plenty of stories and examples that illustrate how to implement these principles into your work, relationships, and family.</p>

Michael Malice is the author of “Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il” and “The New Right: A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics, The White Pill,” and organizer of “The Anarchist Handbook.” He is also the subject of the graphic novel “Ego &amp; Hubris,” written by the late Harvey Pekar of American Splendor fame. He is the host of the podcast, “YOUR WELCOME.” Malice has co-authored books with several prominent personalities, including “Made in America” (the New York Times best-selling autobiography of UFC Hall of Famer Matt Hughes), “Concierge Confidential” (one of NPR’s top 5 celebrity books of the year) and “Black Man, White House” (comedian D. L. Hughley’s satirical look at the Obama years, also a New York Times bestseller). He is also the founding editor of “Overheard in New York.” This episode was filmed on January 6th, 2024. | Links | For Michael Malice: On X https://x.com/michaelmalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/michaelmalice/?hl=en On YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tj5QCpJKIl-KIa4Gib5Xw “The White Pill: A Tale of Good and Evil” (book) https://a.co/d/7OwgieQ</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with entrepreneur and software pioneer, Marc Andreessen. They discuss the timeline of the woke institutional takeover, the ruinous effects it has had on Western ideology and business, the ways in which AI will shape society, and the immense responsibility we have to instill the future with an ethos and morality that serves human flourishing. Marc Andreessen is a cofounder and general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He is an innovator and creator, one of the few to pioneer a software category used by more than a billion people and one of the few to establish multiple billion-dollar companies. Marc co-created the highly influential Mosaic internet browser and co-founded Netscape, which later sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. He also co-founded Loudcloud, which as Opsware, sold to Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion. He later served on the board of Hewlett-Packard from 2008 to 2018. Marc holds a B.S. in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Marc serves on the board of the following Andreessen Horowitz portfolio companies: Applied Intuition, Carta, Coinbase, Dialpad, Flow, Golden, Honor, OpenGov, Samsara, Simple Things, and TipTop Labs. He is also on the board of Meta.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Think about a time you&#39;ve had to speak in front of others — maybe during a work presentation, a wedding toast, or even on a first date. Did you struggle with using too many filler words, such as &#34;um&#34; and &#34;like,&#34; talk too fast, or awkwardly ramble? Most of us try to fix these saboteurs of speech by giving ourselves mental mantras: &#34;Slow down&#34;; &#34;Think about what you want to say.&#34; But my guest would say that becoming a more engaging and effective speaker comes down to realizing that it&#39;s a very physical act that requires getting out of your head and into your body. Michael Chad Hoeppner, a communication coach who has worked with everyone from presidential candidates to business executives, is the author of Don&#39;t Say Um: How to Communicate Effectively to Live a Better Life. Today on the show, Michael explains why you need to treat speaking as a sport and shares embodied drills and exercises — from playing with Legos to talking with a wine cork in your mouth to throwing a ball against a wall — that will fix common delivery problems, including eliminating ums, enhancing vocal variety, and managing your gestures.</p>

But the US has its own peculiar history of failing to regulate dangerously addictive new products, and blaming the users instead. Especially when powerful industry advocates are able to pay scientists to sow doubt and delay the day of reckoning.

In this episode of The REWORK Podcast, 37signals’ co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson discuss the company&#39;s Seven Shipping Principles. They dive into when a product update is good enough to ship and the importance of making updates to solve actual problems.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">I first read Man&#39;s Search for Meaning by the neurologist, psychologist, and philosopher Viktor Frankl in high school, and I have re-read it several times since. It&#39;s one of the books that&#39;s had the biggest impact on my life, so it was a real treat to speak with Alexander Vesely, Frankl&#39;s grandson, about his grandfather&#39;s ideas and legacy. Today on the show, I talk to Alexander, who is a documentarian, and like his grandfather, a psychotherapist, about Frankl&#39;s life, his development of logotherapy, a type of meaning-centered therapy, and how that approach to the psyche was tested during Frankl&#39;s time in the concentration camps. We discuss why Frankl said that &#34;everyone has their own Auschwitz,&#34; how a lack of existential meaning can create depression, the three ways to actualize meaning in your life, whether meaning is something that is objective or subjective, the freedom we have to choose our attitude in all circumstances, including suffering, and more.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Has betting based on inside intel on games gone down since sports gambling was legalized in the US? Not really, as Michael Lewis finds out. But what&#39;s gone up is misery for athletes. We hear from Atlanta Hawks forward Larry Nance, Jr. about the rage, threats and wheedling that pro athletes now endure. The NCAA, former Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, is trying to protect student athletes on campus, while their friends all bet on them, often underaged. Overall, the “integrity landscape” for US sports looks more and more pot-holed by the day. For further reading: NCAA sports wagering surveySee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">January 6 at 3:05 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Hetty Green bailed out New York City. Her decisions on what interest rates to charge moved markets and were reported in major newspapers. She was a one woman bank and the single biggest individual financier in the world. She took no partners and ran her own money. She built a financial empire of stocks, bonds, railroads, and real estate. She battled the great men of her day and kept a gun on her desk. She did all of this alone. Defiantly independent and ferociously intelligent she built a vast, liquid fortune at a time when women couldn&#39;t even vote. She used her intelligence to increase her wealth, her independence to live as she wished, and her strength to battle anyone who stood in her way. This episode is what I learned from reading Hetty: The Genius and Madness of America’s First Female Tycoon by Charles Slack and The Richest Woman in America: Hetty Green in the Gilded Age by Janet Wallach.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">December 30, 2024 at 11:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Think about your habits, the things you do automatically without much thought — from brushing your teeth in the morning to scrolling social media before bed. There’s a lot going on with these behaviors. On one level, they’re just routines and actions wired into our brains through repetition. But there’s also more to it than that. Our habits shape who we are, influence our health and happiness, and determine much of our success in life. There’s a reason changing habits is one of the most powerful ways to transform ourselves. Today on the show, Dr. Gina Cleo will help us understand the science of habit formation and how we can harness it to build better behaviors. Gina is a researcher with a PhD in habit change and the author of The Habit Revolution: Simple Steps to Rewire Your Brain for Powerful Habit Change. Gina and I discuss the three elements of the habit loop and how to hack them to develop good habits and break bad ones. Along the way, we talk about why micro-habits are so effective for creating lasting change, the differences between men and women when it comes to forming habits, how long it really takes for a habit to stick, and much more.</p>

When Chung was in his 80s, he wrote an autobiography that tells the devastating reality of growing up in dire poverty, how he escaped through manual labor, and how he founded and grew one of the world&#39;s largest conglomerates. Along the way he shares advice like why you should emulate bedbugs, the importance of going where the money is, and why people called him &#34;The Bulldozer.&#34; This episode is what I learned from reading Born of This Land: My Life Story by Chung Ju-yung.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Note: This is a rebroadcast. Most everyone wants to live a good, meaningful life, though we don’t always know what that means and how to do it. Plenty of modern self-improvement programs claim to point people in the right direction, but many of the best answers were already offered more than two thousand years ago. My guests have gleaned the cream of this orienting, ancient-yet-evergreen advice from history’s philosophers and shared it in their new book, The Good Life Method: Reasoning Through the Big Questions of Happiness, Faith, and Meaning. Their names are Meghan Sullivan and Paul Blaschko, and they’re professors of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. Today on the show Meghan and Paul introduce us to the world of virtue ethics — an approach to philosophy that examines the nature of the good life, the values and habits that lead to excellence, and how to find and fulfill your purpose as a human being. We discuss how to seek truth with other people by asking them three levels of what they call “strong questions” and engaging in civil and fruitful dialogue. We then delve into why your intentions matter and why you should use “morally thick” language. We also examine the role that work and love has to play in pursuing the good life, and how the latter is very much about attention. We end our conversation with how a life of eudaimonia — full human flourishing — requires balancing action with contemplation.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">December 23, 2024 at 11:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Think of all the texts, emails, and social media posts you&#39;re inundated with each day. Sometimes you read them, and sometimes you swipe them away, telling yourself, perhaps not so honestly, that you&#39;ll revisit them later. If you&#39;re the sender of such missives and memos or the creator of content, you hope the recipient has the first response, that, instead of deep-sixing your message, they take the time to engage and take action on it. How do you increase the odds of that happening? Rather than just guessing at the answer, Todd Rogers has done empirical experiments to discover it. Todd is a behavioral scientist, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, and the author of Writing for Busy Readers: Communicate More Effectively in the Real World. Today on the show, Todd explains the four-stage process people use in deciding whether to engage with your writing, whether in a personal or business context, and how influencing these factors not only comes down to the style of your writing, but its overall design. Todd offers tips to improve both areas, so that you can effectively capture people&#39;s attention.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">December 18, 2024 at 11:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">What if there was one piece of fitness equipment that was affordable, didn’t take up much space, could get you both strong and flexible, and was fun to use? While that might sound too good to be true, my guest, Pat Flynn, would say you can find all those benefits in the old-school kettlebell. Pat, who’s the author of Strong ON!: 101 Minimalist Kettlebell Workouts to Blast Fat, Build Muscle, and Boost Flexibility―in 20 Minutes or Less, calls kettlebells the Swiss Army knife of workout tools and the minimalist’s ultimate secret fitness weapon. Today on the show, we unpack why Pat’s such an advocate for bells, but before we get there, we first take a dive into his background in philosophy and why beginning a workout program takes faith. We then talk about how to use kettlebells to get an all-around fit physique, including the three kettlebell weights that make for an ideal starter set, the two best exercises for building muscle, the pyramid-shaped program that can facilitate body recomposition, how to incorporate progressive overload into kettlebell training, which kettlebell exercise Coach Dan John considers “the fat-burning athlete builder,” the “300 Swings Challenge” that will help you take a Bruce Lee approach to fitness, and much more.</p>

They’re a globally scaled, $50B annual revenue company with no direct competitors — yet have only ~5% market share.

And oh yeah, they also sell hot dogs cheaper than Costco!

Consistency is Key. You&#39;ve heard this before, but what does it mean? Throughout my career, consistency has been key to my success. This has been true both in my habits and in what my work looks like. Most importantly, it&#39;s been important in having any sense of focus at all. But for many of us, there are all kinds of things distracting us, or pulling us in different directions, that make it hard to be consistent.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Meta is a company everyone knows (literally, everyone). But, somehow, it’s also a company that few people feel they actually understand. Their products are used by more humans than any other’s in history — almost half of the entire world’s population daily. But… what is Meta? Why do they do what they do? How do they do what they do? Ask ten people and you’ll likely get ten very different sets of answers.Today, we dive deeper than we’ve ever gone trying to find Acquired’s answers to those questions. And after months of research and 6+ hours of incredible stories about how they (and really “they” being Mark himself) bet it all and win time and time again in the face of overwhelming odds, we arrive at our answers. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, AI, Oculus, Orion, it’s all here.

But… what happened in the twenty years in between? The answer, as we discovered in our research, is probably not what you think.In this episode we explore and analyze the browser wars and the DOJ case, Windows XP through 8, Surface, Xbox, search, Yahoo!, Bing, the iPhone, Nokia, mobile, social, Facebook… and oh yeah, a little thing called Azure and the enterprise — which ended up becoming so big that no failures mattered. Tune in for Microsoft, Volume II.Sponsors:Anrok: https://bit.ly/anrokacquiredWorkOS: https://bit.ly/workos25Statsig: https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24Links:Bill Gurley on Android’s “Less Than Free” business modelAll episode sourcesCarve Outs:Meta Ray-BansOzlo SleepbudsM3 Macbook AirModel YMore Acquired!:Get email updates with hints on next episode and follow-ups from recent episodesJoin the SlackSubscribe to ACQ2Merch Store!© Copyright 2015-2025 ACQ, LLC‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Starbucks. You’d be hard pressed to name any brand that’s more ubiquitous in the world today. With nearly half a billion global customer purchases per week across its stores and 3rd party retail channels, a significant portion of the human population gets their daily fix in the green and white paper cup. (Including our own Ben Gilbert who famously enjoys his daily spinach feta wrap. :)But it wasn’t always this way. Long before the frappuccinos and the PSLs and the cake pops, Starbucks was just a small-time Seattle roaster that only sold beans — and was started not by Howard Schultz but rather the guys who later ran Peet’s (!). Starting from six tiny stores when Howard took over in 1987, this quirky coffee company named after a character from Moby Dick has scaled to nearly 40,000 locations worldwide.Today, in a first for Acquired, the protagonist himself joins us as a third cohost to tell the whole story of Starbucks. And Howard is in the perfect moment to do this — after three separate stints as CEO he’s now retired, off the board of directors, and in his own words “not coming back.” So place a mobile order (or not! as you’ll hear Howard speak about), sit back with your own favorite Starbucks items, and enjoy.Sponsors:Anrok: https://bit.ly/anrokacquiredWorkOS: https://bit.ly/workos25Statsig: https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24The Biggest Thing We’ve Ever Done:San Francisco.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">(I fixed the audio and uploaded a new episode!) &#34;To read Jeff Bezos’s shareholder letters is to get a crash course in running a high-growth internet business from someone who mastered it before any of the playbooks were written.&#34; That is the best description of Bezos&#39;s letters I have ever read. I just finished rereading these letters for the 4th or 5th time. With clear thinking and ferocious intelligence, Bezos provides a masterclass in building a customer-obsessed, enduring franchise. With relentless repetition Bezos teaches us about the importance of invention, risk-taking, wandering, differentiation, technology, judgement, high-standards, customer obsession, long-term orientation, and why value trumps everything.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Jocko Willink — decorated Navy SEAL, best-selling author, and serial entrepreneur — to explore the principles of discipline, leadership, and the relentless pursuit of meaningful goals. From parenting to entrepreneurship, from writing books to rebuilding American factories, this is a masterclass in how to live deliberately and lead effectively. Jocko shares how to recognize the problems that matter, transform them into opportunities, and cultivate the habits that compound into lasting success. Together, they trace the journey of “Way of the Warrior Kid” — from a simple idea to a major motion picture — and reflect on what it means to lead with humility, ask earnest questions, and build a life driven by purpose. Whether you&#39;re trying to straighten out your life, launch a business, or simply stay on the path, this episode is packed with hard-won insight on how to aim upward — and stay there. Jocko Willink is a retired U.S. Navy SEAL officer and decorated combat leader who commanded Task Unit Bruiser—the most highly decorated Special Operations unit of the Iraq War. After 20 years of service, including overseeing SEAL leadership training, he co-founded Echelon Front, a leadership consulting firm where he teaches battlefield-tested principles to business leaders.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 13 at 7:06 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode, I share my conversation with Roberts Rurans, a Latvia-based illustrator who creates all his work using traditional materials — literally painting his images with acrylics. When Roberts talks about his brushes, he means the actual ones lying on his table, not virtual tools in a menu! His process is physical, full of quirks, accidents, and unexpected moments — and yet, his work feels fresh and totally at home in today’s digital illustration landscape.Roberts has worked with clients like Hermès, Nike, Apple, and Coca-Cola, but his artistic integrity shines through no matter the project. In our conversation, we talk about evolving your style, the tension between old and new work, the difference between art and design, and what it’s really like to work 100% analog in a mostly digital world.Toward the end, Roberts answers questions submitted by my Patreon supporters — including whether he secretly uses any digital tools (you’ll have to listen to find out). I wrap things up with some community notes and another “Embarrassing Story of the Episode,” featuring me, a trail run, some hikers caught unawares, and a well-placed band-aid.IN THIS EPISODEHow Roberts Rurans keeps his fully analog style feeling freshThoughts on evolving your style without disowning the pastThe line between art and design in illustrationAnalog tools vs. digital tools — which gives you the edge?PLUS - Embarrassing Moment of the Episode: Shirtless in the ForestSHOW LINKSRoberts Rurans on Instagram – https://www.instagram.com/robertsruransRoberts’s website – https://www.robertsrurans.comHOW TO SUPPORTShare this episode with your friends!Like/Subscribe/Follow/Comment/ReviewBecome a $3 Supporter or $8 Drawing Buddy on Patreon.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Community is one of life&#39;s most valuable but increasingly scarce resources. While we hear about a supposed epidemic of male loneliness, many men still resist joining groups or struggle to maintain involvement after initial enthusiasm wanes. Today on the show, Frank Schwartz will help us understand the barriers to building male community and how to overcome them. Frank is the CEO of F3, a free, all-volunteer men&#39;s leadership organization that uses workouts to bring men together and supports hundreds of decentralized chapters worldwide. In the first half of our conversation, Frank explains the psychology behind men&#39;s hesitation to join groups, how to navigate the &#34;wish dream&#34; of idealized community, and why expecting perfection kills participation. We then discuss what makes leadership in a decentralized group different from traditional hierarchies, the importance of embracing messiness, and why allowing men to make their own decisions creates stronger leaders than giving them a rulebook to follow. We end our conversation with Frank&#39;s perspective on cultivating patience as a leader and how to measure success when building a community of men.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 8 at 8:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan Peterson breaks down what the media has framed as a battle between Harvard University and the Trump administration—but it&#39;s much deeper than that. Peterson exposes the ideological decay at the heart of elite academic institutions, driven by the dogma of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and enforced through cowardice, corruption, and groupthink. From firsthand experience at Harvard, McGill, and the University of Toronto, Peterson connects the dots between academia&#39;s collapse and its ripple effect on society. With insights into why DEI statements are eroding scientific credibility, how universities became ideological factories, and why the future of higher education may lie in alternatives like Peterson Academy, this episode is a must-watch for anyone who cares about truth, merit, and intellectual freedom.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Figuring out the pitfalls and best practices of adulthood can be tricky. It&#39;s helpful to have some pearls of wisdom to guide you along the way. My guest today has spent decades collecting these kinds of helpful truths and has crafted her own guiding mantras of maturity. Gretchen Rubin is the author of numerous bestselling books, including The Happiness Project, and her latest, Secrets of Adulthood. Today on the show, Gretchen shares how she came to write hundreds of aphorisms on how to navigate life, and we dig into some of my favorites of these concise, sage sayings. Amongst many topics, we discuss why &#34;happiness doesn&#39;t always make us feel happy,&#34; the best strategy for changing ourselves, a very useful heuristic for making decisions, why you should wear a favorite sweater more often, and even why big top tables at restaurants are one of my pet peeves.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 5 at 8:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Is the radical right becoming the very thing it hates? Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Dr. James Lindsay to unpack the rise of the &#34;Woke Right&#34;—a faction of online reactionaries using the same tactics of victimhood, outrage mobs, and cult-like behavior once exclusive to the radical left. Together, they explore how parasitic ideologies hijack belief systems, mimic virtue, and weaponize social media to manipulate the masses. From cluster B psychopathology to Nazi apologetics, from Marx to modern meme culture, this is a deep dive into the psychological and ideological rot infecting both ends of the spectrum. If you&#39;ve sensed that something is deeply wrong in today’s culture wars—on both sides—this episode puts it into words. Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory. Dr. Lindsay is the Founder of New Discourses, an organization dedicated to shining the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. Dr. Lindsay is the co-author of “Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity―and Why This Harms Everybody” and is the author of “Race Marxism,” as well as his newest book, “The Marxification of Education.” Dr. Lindsay has been a featured guest on Fox News, Glenn Beck, Joe Rogan, and NPR, and he has spoken at the Oxford Union and the EU Parliament. This episode was filmed on April, 29th, 2025. | Links | For Dr. James Lindsay: On X https://x.com/ConceptualJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor On YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@newdiscourses/videos Read his latest book, “The Queering of the American Child: How a New School Religious Cult Poisons the Minds and Bodies of Normal Kids” https://a.co/d/9lpXvGc</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">May 1 at 8:30 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Jim Simons never took a single class on finance, wasn’t interested in business, and didn’t start trading full time until he was 40. The company he founded — Renaissance Technologies — has made over $100 billion in profits. Starting out with the heretical belief that there was a hidden structure in financial markets, Jim decided to staff his “crazy hedge fund” with mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists. He went to great lengths to collect more historic financial data than anyone else, spent a lot of time recruiting “killers” (people with single minded focus that wouldn’t quit), invested heavily in computers (and the people who ran them), and designed the most collaborative work environment. Jim was a world-class mathematician, code breaker, exceptional manager of people with exceptional minds, a genius in system design, and deeply understood the power of incentives. He was also incapable of giving up, willing to endure a decade of struggle and pain, and hell-bent on doing something “historic” with his life. Jim Simons lived a life defined by persistence, unconventional thinking, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. Studying his life and work is time well spent. This episode is what I learned from rereading The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman.</p>

A Harvard and UPenn MD/MBA graduate, Oz also co-founded the influential health platform Sharecare and the nationwide teen wellness initiative Healthcorps.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 29 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Feelings of burnout and boredom have become prevalent in modern life. To understand the roots of and solutions to these issues, we can turn to both ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers. Among the latter is Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han, whose thought-provoking analyses are gaining increasing recognition. If you’re not yet familiar with Han’s philosophy, Steven Knepper, a professor at the Virginia Military Institute and the co-author of a new critical introduction to this modern philosopher’s work, will take us on a tour of some of Han’s key ideas. In the first part of our conversation, Steven unpacks Han’s concept of the “burnout society” and why so many of us feel tired from participating in what he calls “auto-exploitation” and “positive violence.” We then discuss how our burnout society is also a “palliative society” that tries to avoid suffering at all costs and how our obsession with health has turned us into a modern version of Nietzsche’s “last man.” We end our discussion with some of Han’s ideas for resisting the pitfalls of modernity, including embracing ritual, contemplation, and an openness to the mystery of others.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 28 at 8:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dr. Jordan B. Peterson engages in conversation with Charlie Kirk—author, speaker, and founder and CEO of Turning Point USA. They delve into Kirk’s emergence as a leading voice in the Conservative movement, his choice to bypass traditional higher education, and the early indicators of ideological bias in academia. The discussion also addresses how the university system has not only tilted toward the hyper-feminine but has transformed into a large-scale scam. Additionally, they examine academia’s departure from timeless questions of good and evil, faith, and foundational philosophy, to a focus on Marxist economics and cultural capture. Charlie Kirk is the Founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rallying, organizing, and empowering students to advocate for principles of freedom, free markets, and limited government. With a presence on more than 3,500 high school and college campuses in all 50 states, and supported by over 350 full-time staff members, Turning Point USA stands as the nation’s largest and fastest-growing conservative youth activist organization. In addition to Turning Point USA’s on-campus presence, it also operates a massive online outreach initiative that garners billions of video views annually and reaches millions of Americans every day with conservative, pro-America content. In addition to his role at Turning Point USA, Charlie also serves as the CEO and founder of Turning Point Action, a related entity operating under a 501(c)(4) status. Turning Point Action’s mission is to embolden the conservative base through grassroots activism and to provide voters with the necessary resources to elect true conservative leaders. Turning Point Action has earned recognition as one of the leading grassroots forces in the country today.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">In this episode I talk about why it’s so hard to make digital art look more natural. For many of us, we work digitally out of convenience but really want our work to have a more analogue appearance — as though it were made using physical media. I explain why this is harder than you might think, citing 3 key factors I’ve encountered in my own experience. Then, I offer 5 more practical ways you can overcome these challenges and make your work look more natural.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 24 at 8:15 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel sits down with Jordan Peterson for a powerful conversation about why real progress has stalled. Thiel argues that the last truly groundbreaking achievement may have been landing on the moon—and since then, we&#39;ve slowed down. He explains how fear, red tape, and over-specialization have made us more cautious and less ambitious. They dig into how society has shifted away from building and inventing, toward digital distractions and endless talk. They also explore what’s been lost as faith and meaning have disappeared from public life. From broken universities to status-driven culture wars, this is a deep and thought-provoking look at the challenges facing the West—and what we might do to turn things around. Peter Thiel is a German-born entrepreneur, venture capitalist, activist, and billionaire who emigrated to the U.S. as a child, eventually settling in California after years of moving between countries. A Stanford Law graduate, he began his career as a clerk and derivatives trader before founding Thiel Capital with $1 million from friends and family. Despite early setbacks, he co-founded Confinity, which became PayPal, launching a streak of ventures including Palantir, Clarium Capital, and early investment in Facebook. Thiel is an openly gay supporter of the Republican party, advocating for both equal rights and certain conservative policies, making his political stance admirably nuanced.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 22 at 7:58 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Akio Morita was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Sony. Born as the first son and fifteenth-generation heir to a 300-year-old sake-brewing family in Japan, Akio eschewed the traditional path to forge his own legacy in electronics. In post-war Japan, Akio joined forces with Masaru Ibuka to found Sony. They started in a burned-out department store with limited resources—to build their first product they had to buy supplies on the black market. Akio was determined to change the global perception of Japanese goods as poor quality. From day one he set out to build high-quality, differentiated products, targeted at affluent markets. Akio believed in long-term vision over short-term profits, product innovation without market research, and brand building over immediate profits. Against all opposition, including inside of his own company, Akio invented one of the most successful consumer products of all time: The Walkman. It sold over 400 million units and inspired countless other entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, James Dyson, and Phil Knight. This episode is what I learned from rereading Akio&#39;s classic 1986 autobiography Made In Japan.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 22 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Note: This is a rebroadcast. Do you have a goal to lose weight? If so, you&#39;re probably thinking about how you need to exercise more. And that can certainly help. But what about the 23 hours a day you&#39;re not at the gym? How much you move during those hours — from walking to the mailbox to fidgeting at your desk — can be just as important in winning the battle of the bulge. Here to explain the importance of what&#39;s called non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT, is Dr. James Levine, a professor, the co-director of the Mayo Clinic&#39;s Obesity Solutions Initiative, the inventor of the treadmill desk, and the author of Get Up!: Why Your Chair Is Killing You and What You Can Do About It. James explains how much more sedentary we are than we used to be and what happens to your body when, as the average American does, you spend two-thirds of your day sitting. He shares how doing the lightest kinds of physical activity, even standing more, can help you lose a significant amount of weight and improve other aspects of health, from your sleep to your mood. And we talk about how to easily incorporate more NEAT into your day.</p>

Peterson sits down with athlete, philanthropist, and speaker Tim Tebow to discuss the connection between competitive drive, personal virtue, and Christian compassion. Tebow recounts the life-changing encounter that inspired his foundation — a moment in a remote Filipino village, where he met a disabled boy hidden away from the world. From that day forward, his focus shifted from MVP titles to serving the most vulnerable. Together, they explore the demonization of masculinity, the crisis facing young men today, and how athletic excellence, when rooted in higher purpose, can become a force for good. This is a conversation about strength, faith, responsibility, and redemption — and what it truly means to win at life. Timothy Richard Tebow, born August 14, 1987, in Makati, the Philippines to missionary parents Bob and Pam Tebow, is an American professional baseball player, former professional football player, 3x NY Times best-selling author, international speaker, and ESPN sports broadcaster. He played college football for the University of Florida, and in 2007 became the first player to win the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore. Tim is also a 2x BCS National Champion. In the NFL, Tim played for the Denver Broncos, the New York Jets, the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. He is currently playing baseball as an outfielder and designated hitter with the New York Mets MLB team.

And that farm contained the world’s largest subterranean auditorium, as well as Disneyland—style replicas of Hogwarts and the Emerald City? What if we told you that the person who started, runs and owns this establishment has legally ensured that it will never be sold, never go public and never acquire another company? And that this person, Judy Faulkner, is also likely the wealthiest and most successful self-made woman in history?Welcome to the story of Epic Systems, the software company that underpins the majority of the American healthcare system today. Epic isn’t “just” an electronic medical record (the category it’s usually lumped into), or an online patient portal (which is how most of the US population interacts with it via its MyChart application). It’s more akin to a central nervous system for hospitals and health clinics. Almost everything in a hospital — from patient interactions to billing, staffing, scheduling, prescriptions and even research — happens on Epic’s platform, and over 90% of American medical schools’ graduating doctors, nurses and health administrative staff are trained on it during their educations. Tune in as we dive into the almost-unbelievable story of how this epic company came to be!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 17 at 10:21 PM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Regenerative farming pioneer Joel Salatin joins Dr. Jordan B. Peterson to challenge the myth that cows are bad for the planet. They explore how pasture-based farming restores ecosystems, the dangers of industrial agriculture, and why storytelling matters in the fight for the future of food. Joel Salatin, dubbed the &#34;Lunatic Farmer,&#34; is a Christian libertarian environmentalist and one of the most outspoken voices in regenerative agriculture. Co-owner of Polyface Farm in Virginia, he supplies thousands with pasture-raised meats and teaches sustainable farming worldwide. With 16 books, such as “The Omnivore’s Dilemma,&#34; countless columns, and a wildly engaging speaking style, Salatin blends mischief, grit, and deep cultural insight to challenge how we think about food, freedom, and stewardship of the land.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 15 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">The era of artificially intelligent large language models is upon us and isn&#39;t going away. Rather, AI tools like ChatGPT are only going to get better and better and affect more and more areas of human life. If you haven&#39;t yet felt both amazed and unsettled by these technologies, you probably haven&#39;t explored their true capabilities. My guest today will explain why everyone should spend at least 10 hours experimenting with these chatbots, what it means to live in an age where AI can pass the bar exam, beat humans at complex tests, and even make us question our own creative abilities, what AI might mean for the future of work and education, and how to use these new tools to enhance rather than detract from your humanity. Ethan Mollick is a professor at the Wharton business school and the author of Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI. Today on the show, Ethan explains the impact of the rise of AI and why we should learn to utilize tools like ChatGPT as a collaborator — a co-worker, co-teacher, co-researcher, and coach. He offers practical insights into harnessing AI to complement your own thinking, remove tedious tasks from your workday, and amplify your productivity. We&#39;ll also explore how to craft effective prompts for large language models, maximize their potential, and thoughtfully navigate what may be the most profound technological shift of our lifetimes.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">This is one of the most extraordinary founder stories you will ever hear. Michael Dell started his company with $1000 when he was 19 years old. The revenues for the first 16 years of Dell look like this: 1984 $6M 1985 $33M 1986 $67M 1987 $159M 1988 $258M 1989 $388M 1990 $546M 1991 $890M 1992 $2B 1993 $2.9B 1994 $3.5B 1995 $5.3B 1996 $7.8B 1997 $12.3B 1998 $18.2B 1999 $25.3B Dell had been profitable for every quarter of its existence. By 2012 the story had changed. The consensus was that Dell was dead. Michael Dell certainly didn&#39;t think so — and besides—he was incapable of giving up on the company that bears his name. As he said at the time &#34;I will care about this company after I&#39;m dead!&#34; Michael takes his company private, completes the largest acquisition in technology history, and remerges perfectly positioned for the age of AI. Michael Dell has been working on his company for over 40 years and it feels like he&#39;s just getting started. In his autobiography he shares the most important lessons he&#39;s learned. It&#39;s a treasure trove for entrepreneurs and leaders. This episode is what I learned from reading Play Nice But Win: A CEO&#39;s Journey From Founder to Leader by Michael Dell and Direct From Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry by Michael Dell.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 8 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When you scroll through social media feeds today, you’ll find countless posts about “living your truth” and “being authentic.” These ideas feel so natural to us now that we rarely stop to ask where they came from or what they really mean. The concept of identity — how we understand ourselves — has undergone a radical transformation over the centuries. What once was defined primarily by external markers like family, profession, and community has shifted dramatically toward inner feelings, desires, and psychological experiences. Today on the show, Carl Trueman unpacks this profound change and how we got to the lens through which we view ourselves today. Carl is a professor, theologian, and the author of The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self. Throughout our conversation, he explores the insights of three key thinkers — Charles Taylor, Philip Rieff, and Alasdair MacIntyre — who have mapped the historical and cultural shifts that have transformed our ideas of identity. We discuss how this transformation has reshaped politics, education, and religion, while considering whether we’ve lost something essential in moving from a shared understanding of human nature to an increasingly individualized conception of self.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Because of the podcast I get to meet a lot of super successful people. I&#39;m always asking them &#34;Who is the smartest person you know&#34; and &#34;Who do you think has the best business?&#34;. &#34;Ken Griffin&#34; is a very common answer. I&#39;ve heard Ken described in two ways: &#34;Winner&#34; and &#34;Killer&#34;. For years I&#39;ve come across interesting anecdotes about Ken. Like when he appears as a 19 year old kid in Ed Thorp&#39;s excellent autobiography A Man For All Markets. Or when John Arnold describe Ken&#39;s intense competitive drive following the blowup of Enron. And then consider the fact that I&#39;m obsessed with people who run their business for decades (Ken founded Citadel 35 years ago and Citadel Securities 23 years ago) —and I knew I had to make an episode about his life and work. The only problem was there&#39;s no great biography of Ken. So to make this episode I transcribed this talk that Ken gave at Yale. And for additional context I read the book Hardball: Are You Playing to Play or Playing to Win.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">April 1 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Resilience is often touted as the end all, be all of coping with life&#39;s challenges and setbacks. But my guest knows from her studies, executive coaching, and her own life that sometimes resilience just isn&#39;t enough. You need an even more durable source of strength. Dr. Tasha Eurich is an organizational psychologist and researcher and the author of Shatterproof: How to Thrive in a World of Constant Chaos. Today on the show, Tasha explains why the concept of resilience rose to prominence in the 2010s, how resilience can be improved a little as a skill, but is largely an exhaustible capacity, and how you know when you&#39;re hitting your &#34;resilience ceiling.&#34; We then talk about the more sustainable skillset and strength of becoming shatterproof. We discuss the potential to grow forward instead of simply bouncing back, the psychological needs that have to be met to become shatterproof, and research-backed tools for thriving in life instead of just surviving.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 25 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">The human urge to explore has taken us to every corner of the planet. From the highest peaks to far-flung islands to even the deepest dimensions of an idea, our species has an innate drive to venture into the unknown. But what exactly drives this need to explore? Is it genetic, cognitive, or something else entirely? Here to unpack this question is Alex Hutchinson, author of The Explorers Gene: Why We Seek Big Challenges, New Flavors, and the Blank Spots on the Map. Today on the show, Alex shares the fascinating science behind our exploratory tendencies, from the dopamine-driven &#34;explorer&#39;s gene&#34; that varies across populations to the universal cognitive frameworks that govern how we navigate both physical and mental landscapes. He explains the delicate balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting what we already know, and why we sometimes find meaning in difficult challenges. We also discuss why younger people explore more than older people do, how this decline in exploration doesn&#39;t have to be inevitable, and how to keep exploring throughout your entire life.</p>

That’s a surprising episode.” Well, if you’re in group two, boy do we have a treat for you!IPL is the fastest-growing, most dynamic and most disruptive force in the sports industry today… and this may come as a shock to many Americans, but it might just be on track to surpass the NFL as the world’s most valuable sports league. The IPL is currently valued at $16B, with a TV rights deal that’s higher in per-match dollars than the NBA and the English Premier League. And all this for a league that’s right now just 10 teams who collectively only play 74 total games per season… and oh yeah, the whole thing is only 17 years old! Tune in for an absolutely amazing story, filled with genius, drama (Rupert Murdoch! Disney! Bollywood!) and a perfect encapsulation of the rise of modern India.Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

He built a massive conglomerate of over 200 companies operating in more than 50 countries. Spending the time to learn how he did this is a great investment.

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 18 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">When you think about ancient gladiators, you likely have a certain vision that comes to mind: slaves forced to fight to the death for the entertainment of bloodthirsty Romans. But much of what we think we know about gladiators is actually wrong. Today on the show, Alexander Mariotti will separate the just-as-fascinating fact from popular-culture-derived fiction when it comes to gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome. Alexander is a historian and an expert on gladiators who&#39;s served as a consultant for shows and films like Spartacus and Gladiator II. In our conversation, Alexander explains how gladiatorial games evolved from funeral rites into professional sporting events featuring the greatest superstar athletes and sex symbols of the day. We discuss the different types of gladiators, their rigorous training regimens, why gladiators fought in their underwear, and whether they actually fought to the death. Alexander describes what a day at the Colosseum was really like, complete with elaborate special effects, halftime shows, souvenirs, and even concessions. And we talk about the connections between the gladiatorial games and the sports and spectacle culture of today, and why, despite the passage of two millennia, these ancient athletes continue to captivate our imagination.</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 17 at 1:45 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Todd Graves is one of my favorite living entrepreneurs. He&#39;s a great example of Charlie Munger&#39;s maxim: Find a simple idea and take it seriously. Todd wanted to create a quick service restaurant that only focused on quality chicken finger meals and nothing else. Everyone told him that couldn&#39;t possibly work. The college paper that described the idea that would turn into Raising Canes got the lowest grade in the class. Banks wouldn&#39;t loan him any money —but nothing could stop Todd from living out his &#34;chicken finger dream.&#34; He worked 95 hour weeks as a boilermaker, risked his life on a commercial fishing boat off the coast of Alaska, and scrounged up startup money from his bookie and a guy named Wild Bill. Todd made every mistake in the book, over leveraged himself, almost lost everything and yet he refused to give up or sell out. Today he has over 800 locations, 50,000 employees, and owns 90% of a business that&#39;s worth at least $10 billion. Todd&#39;s maxim is &#34;Do one thing and do it better than anyone else.&#34;</p>

                <div class="text-muted small mb-2">March 11 at 10:00 AM</div>
                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Face-to-face socializing in America has declined by more than 20% nationwide. Among some groups, like young adults and unmarried men, the drop is closer to 40%. But strangely, this hasn’t led to the loneliness epidemic that you hear so much about. Instead, we’re seeing a new phenomenon: rising aloneness without rising loneliness. Today on the show, Derek Thompson will help us understand this puzzling disconnect and its profound implications. Derek is a staff writer at The Atlantic who recently wrote a piece entitled “The Anti-Social Century.” In the first half of our conversation, Derek unpacks the cultural shifts and technological developments — and no, it’s not just the smartphone — that have created what he calls the “convenience curse.” We then get into why even self-described introverts are often happier when forced to socialize, the concerning trend of young men settling further and further into isolating, sedentary leisure, and practical ways we can strengthen our atrophied social muscles to become better, happier people.</p>

As the Wall Street Journal wrote: When the history of Hollywood is written, few people will have played a larger role than Michael Ovitz.

They sell obsolete and objectively inferior mechanical devices for 10-1000x the price of their superior digital successors… and demand is stronger than ever in history! Their products are comparable to a Hermès Birkin bag in price, luxury status and waitlist times… yet they produce over 1m units / year (roughly 10x annual Birkin production). They make the most universally recognized and desired Swiss watches… yet their founder wasn’t Swiss and didn’t start the company in Switzerland! If Rolex were publicly traded, they’d almost certainly be among the top 50 market cap companies in the world… yet they’re 100% owned by a charitable foundation in Geneva that (among other things) literally just gives away money to local people in the city.Tune in for one of the most fascinating and admirable companies we’ve ever covered on Acquired.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">We flew to Taiwan to interview TSMC Founder Morris Chang in a rare English interview. In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we most regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.Dr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025. Please enjoy!Sponsors:Many thanks to our fantastic Spring ‘25 Season partners:J.P.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Michael Lewis gets a glimpse of sports gambling&#39;s future by talking with writers in Great Britain and Australia, where the industry is even more entrenched. But the US has its own peculiar history of failing to regulate dangerously addictive new products, and blaming the users instead. Especially when powerful industry advocates are able to pay scientists to sow doubt and delay the day of reckoning.

                <p class="card-text text-truncate">Has betting based on inside intel on games gone down since sports gambling was legalized in the US? Not really, as Michael Lewis finds out. But what&#39;s gone up is misery for athletes. We hear from Atlanta Hawks forward Larry Nance, Jr. about the rage, threats and wheedling that pro athletes now endure. The NCAA, former Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, is trying to protect student athletes on campus, while their friends all bet on them, often underaged. Overall, the “integrity landscape” for US sports looks more and more pot-holed by the day. For further reading: NCAA sports wagering surveySee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.</p>

Their products are used by more humans than any other’s in history — almost half of the entire world’s population daily. But… what is Meta? Why do they do what they do? How do they do what they do? Ask ten people and you’ll likely get ten very different sets of answers.Today, we dive deeper than we’ve ever gone trying to find Acquired’s answers to those questions. And after months of research and 6+ hours of incredible stories about how they (and really “they” being Mark himself) bet it all and win time and time again in the face of overwhelming odds, we arrive at our answers.
